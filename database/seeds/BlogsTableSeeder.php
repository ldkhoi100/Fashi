<p>Hey guys! Real talk&hellip; I don&rsquo;t post as much as I used to on the blog, and I wanted to see how many of you guys still enjoy coming here for content? &nbsp;This has been such an incredible journey, and even though social platforms are where we spend a lot of our time, I&rsquo;m forever grateful for you following along, old and new, who read here. It means so much! I like the blog because it allows me to share a lot more and write more!</p>

<p>My blog, like my clothing line ILY Couture, has always gradually evolved with me. For those of you who may not remember, I started ILY when I was engaged and looking for some headpieces to wear to my wedding. I couldn&rsquo;t find what I wanted, so I decided to make my own! From there, it evolved to jewelry, women and kids clothing and more. I remember when I got pregnant with Beckam, we made our &lsquo;Preggers&rsquo; tee, and then our iconic &lsquo;Wifey&rsquo; tee. Hello Fashion has been evolving also &ndash; initially just fashion, then expanding to include family and lifestyle, beauty, travel, home decor, and more. I feel like you guys are truly friends and I love the community we&rsquo;ve created, so it feels right to share the natural progression of my life.</p>

<p>After having Ollie I did a Q&amp;A on insta and asked what you missed seeing and people said fashion. I hadn&rsquo;t even realized it but None of my recent pictures on Insta were in jeans, but then upon a closer look I realized I had barely posted jeans in the year prior (part of that was just living in swimsuits and dresses during my pregnancy 🙂 and it occurred to me how much my brand has grown to be more lifestyle than just fashion. I have always loved fashion and love sharing my new finds with you guys, but as I&rsquo;ve been trying to reflect on my brand, I wanted to give you guys a chance to weigh in. The last thing I want this to be is asking you guys &lsquo;What content do you want to see more of?&rdquo; that has been so prevalent this year. But for those of you who read here &ndash; what do you love the most? &nbsp;fashion and street style? Or do you prefer the family content at home?&nbsp; I would love to hear your thoughts below. And thank you guys from the bottom of my heart for being here throughout this journey of life. 🙂 Hope you guys are all staying safe during the quarantine!</p>',

Although it can be hard to give them structure, keep up with homeschooling, prepare 3 meals a day, and still keep up with work at the same time. We get so caught up in the things we &lsquo;have to&rsquo; do, that we might forget to take advantage of the time together with our family and just play! Here is a list of 17 ways to turn quarantine time into quality time together and maybe even overshadow this chapter of our lives with unforgettable memories together.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="quality time with kids" src="https://www.hellofashionblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/book.gif" style="height:1024px; width:682px" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Read together:&nbsp;</strong>Let your kids pick their favorite books, and instead of squeezing it in before bed you can make a routine out of it during the day.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="how to turn quarantine into quality time with family" src="https://www.hellofashionblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/1O8A4650-1.jpg" style="height:1904px; width:1360px" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Exercise:</strong>&nbsp;Grab some mats and do some&nbsp;<a href="https://bit.ly/3drPeNM" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">yoga</a>, a quick home workout, or take a walk together! (Anything to burn some energy, am I right?) Side note &ndash; a lot of you have asked about my code for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.obefitness.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">obe at home workouts</a>. Use code: CHRISTINEMONTH to get your first month free (valid through March 31st. 🙂</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Build a Fort:</strong>&nbsp;Build a fort in your living room then have a movie night with popcorn and everyone&rsquo;s favorite treat!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="keeping kids occupied during shelter in place" src="https://www.hellofashionblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/208YsPpP-scaled.jpeg" style="height:2560px; width:1707px" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Play Restaurant:</strong>&nbsp;Make a menu and have a 3 course meal. Mara loves playing waitress and serving all of us! You can keep this one up by picking a different &lsquo;restaurant&rsquo; every night &ndash; one night can be Italian, another Mexican, etc.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://www.hellofashionblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Photo-Jul-28-4-25-16-PM.jpg" style="height:1814px; width:1360px" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Have an indoor rodeo:</strong>&nbsp;Get some&nbsp;<a href="https://bit.ly/2wwZ6FA" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">pony sticks</a>&nbsp;(unless dad is game to participate 😉 and let the kids race each other around the room. You can also add obstacles like couch pillows, etc. for some makeshift barrel racing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://www.hellofashionblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/GC6A9461.jpg" style="height:2040px; width:1360px" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Learn a new skill:</strong>&nbsp;Pick up a new hobby! You can learn anything from baking, language, an instrument, etc. Beckam has been DYING to learn guitar so I ordered him a guitar and am going to youtube some basic lessons for him.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://www.hellofashionblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/by2GGF5u.jpg" style="height:1600px; width:1067px" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Write a letter to their grandparents:&nbsp;</strong>No matter how near or far your kids&rsquo; grandparents live, keeping them connected the old fashioned way is the way to go, now more than ever! Add some homemade artwork for an extra treat (and probably a soon-to-be addition to grandma and grandpa&rsquo;s fridge. 🙂</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Have a backyard campfire and roast some hot dogs and marshmallows:&nbsp;</strong>Any time you can spend outside enjoying some fresh air is a win in our book! For a memorable night, have a spontaneous camping trip in your own backyard or back patio. You can light up&nbsp;<a href="https://bit.ly/2vONEow" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">the fire pit</a>&nbsp;if you have one to roast marshmallows. It&rsquo;s also the perfect chance to download a star-gazing app and learn some of the constellations. We love&nbsp;<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/skyview-lite/id413936865" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">this one</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Have a spa day:&nbsp;</strong>Everybody could use some extra R&amp;R right now, so make a day of it and have everyone participate in spa day! You can set out everyone&rsquo;s robes (<a href="https://bit.ly/2QFR6c0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">this one</a>&nbsp;is my ultimate favorite; also love&nbsp;<a href="https://bit.ly/3dr1bU9" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">these cute striped options</a>&nbsp;for the kids) and slippers and arrange multiple stations &ndash; a swimsuit bubble bath, fun face masks, a foot massage station &ndash; I can&rsquo;t promise it won&rsquo;t make a mess but I can promise it will make a great memory!</p>

<p><strong>Pull out your favorite games:&nbsp;</strong>From your family&rsquo;s favorite board games to bring out everyone&rsquo;s competitive sides. We&rsquo;ve played probably 15 games of&nbsp;<a href="https://bit.ly/3dk8k8C" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Sorry</a>&nbsp;already and Cody and I love&nbsp;<a href="https://bit.ly/2wpsH3S" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Monopoly Deal</a>! You can also play tic-tac-toe and hangman on the driveway with&nbsp;<a href="https://bit.ly/399d2mo" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">chalk</a>, or collaborate on a family puzzle.</p>

<p><strong>Set up an at home treasure hunt:</strong>&nbsp;For St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day, Cody and I set up a trail of Lucky Charms that led the kids to find their &lsquo;treasure&rsquo;. They loved it and it was a welcomed distraction from everything going on. It&rsquo;s a great way to celebrate birthdays or an incentive for doing chores around the house, etc.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Take a walk to the park and have a picnic:</strong>&nbsp;Head outside for some fresh air. Even if you are avoiding the playground, you should be able to find the perfect spot to lay down a blanket and set up a picnic.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Take on a Tiktok trend:&nbsp;</strong>We love trying our hand at the latest Tiktok crazes! Some of the ones the kids have loved: learning how to make thread bracelets,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@codywestonandrew" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">hydro-dipping</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B8QFwQjgjeY/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">learning new dances</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@christine_andrew/video/6797117338454985989" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">trying out the challenges</a>. If you aren&rsquo;t following already come hang with us&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@christine_andrew" rel="nofollow">on TikTok: @christine_andrew</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Paint:</strong>&nbsp;Using your fingers or paint brushes, your kids will love to create something new! It&rsquo;s so fun to see what their little imaginations come up with. How cute are&nbsp;<a href="https://bit.ly/33EF9bY" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">these little &lsquo;paint your own&rsquo; kits</a>? Love!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Challenge yourself with LEGOS.&nbsp;</strong>There&rsquo;s no time like the present to tackle&nbsp;<a href="https://bit.ly/2vNbUaw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">that intimidating LEGO set</a>&nbsp;the kids have been asking to open.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Let them be the boss for the day:&nbsp;Granted, you might have to add some parameters depending on the direction they go, but let your kids rule the roost for the day! They can have their choice between a few options for dinner, decide on games, activities, etc. &ndash; such a fun opportunity to see what they would do on their dream day!</strong></p>

<p>I would love to keep the list going! If you guys want to add some fun ideas below in comments, I&rsquo;ll add a list of your additional ideas to the end of the post!</p>',

<p>Hi hi!! &nbsp;Today I am excited to share the five things I have been loving lately&hellip; &nbsp;</p>

<ol>
<li dir="ltr">
<p>My new Starbucks drink. I love trying new drinks and always love the new holiday flavors!! You need to try the Salted Caramel Mocha with white mocha and extra caramel! Haha basically its pure sugar but it&rsquo;s so good. I&rsquo;m trying to do less sugar right now to help get pregnant &ndash; and I have been craving one SO BAD. You will thank me later 😉</p>
</li>
<li>Boots! &nbsp;Now that its so cold outside I am loving all different kinds of boots.&nbsp;<a href="https://two24.ariat.com/P15994_W_FOO.html?dwvar_P15994__W__FOO_color=BLACK" rel="nofollow">The boots</a>&nbsp;in my pictures above that I also shared last week have still been on repeat! &nbsp;Also loving&nbsp;<a href="https://bit.ly/2PfpR9N" rel="nofollow">these</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://bit.ly/2PkUE4S" rel="nofollow">these</a>&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;<a href="https://bit.ly/2QynOdy" rel="nofollow">these</a>!</li>
<li>Neutral nails &ndash; I have been doing gel nails forever but my nails feel so weak lately I took it off a couple weeks ago and went with a super soft almost sheer color. I have gotten so many compliments on them this week!</li>
<li>The book&nbsp;<a href="https://bit.ly/2OMQti6" rel="nofollow"><em>Girl Wash Your Face</em></a>&nbsp;&ndash; I&rsquo;m just starting it a couple chapters in, my sister and laws and I are doing a book club together on it. I was having a really down day when I started it and it helped me get out of funk and change my attitude &ndash; its really good so far!</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p>Beckam and his new love for arts &amp; crafts!&nbsp; I was an Art major in college so the artist in me has been dying for him to want to get crafty with me. He used to color for like 2 minutes and would be over it and lately he&rsquo;s been wanting to do all things crafty. His preschool really pushes arts and crafts and it makes me so happy he likes doing them at home now too! He asked for a coloring book at the store the other day and I was SO excited haha. I know it&rsquo;s silly but I have looked forward to the day we just sit and color by the fireplace.</p>

<p>If you had to choose the most important colors to form the basis of a tailored&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/tech-tools-for-wardrobe/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Tech Tools For Wardrobe Management">wardrobe</a>, they would be blue, particularly navy blue, followed closely by gray. These hues not only play well with various other shades but also work beautifully with one another, thus making them the most versatile color pairing in menswear.</p>

<h2>How to Wear Blue and Gray</h2>

<h3>Blue and Gray with a Suit and Tie</h3>

<p>The easiest way to coordinate blue and gray is to match the two in a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-to-button-your-suits/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="How To Button Your Suits, Jackets, Vests, Overcoats, &amp; Tuxedo">suit</a>&nbsp;and tie combination.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s commonly said that when a man first ventures into the world of tailored clothing&ndash;or into the working world that demands such a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/the-dress-code-primer/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="The Dress Code Primer">dress code</a>&ndash;he should begin with a navy blue suit. Using a gray&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/essential-ties-every-man-should-invest-in/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="12 Essential Ties Every Man Should Invest In">tie</a>&nbsp;with this navy suit is a surefire way to earn style points.</p>

<p>The second suit a man should own when starting a business wardrobe is a gray one, but here the recommendations vary between a mid-gray and a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/the-charcoal-brown-suit/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="The Charcoal Brown Suit">charcoal</a>. In either case, you simply take the opposite approach as your first suit and coordinate with a blue tie. The entire range of gray presents a neutral backdrop for any mid &ndash; to navy blue tie to work. And, the fact that both blue and gray are cool colors ensures they will pair naturally. Even if your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-to-pair-shirts-ties-with-gray-suits/">gray suit</a>&nbsp;contains warmer brown tones, you&rsquo;ll have no issues because blue also combines perfectly with brown.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/James-Bond-Gray-and-Blue.jpeg"><img alt="Daniel Craig as James Bond in a mid-gray suit with mid-blue tie." src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/James-Bond-Gray-and-Blue-1030x626.jpeg" style="height:626px; width:1030px" /></a></p>

<h4>Avoid Strong Contrast</h4>

<p>Although pairing a gray tie with a blue suit and vice versa is nearly foolproof, there are some ways for you to make the most of this combination. For one thing, avoid too strong a contrast between the two colors, which is the general rule for any color coordination. So, if your suit is dark gray, avoid a really pale blue.</p>

<p><img alt="A black and white glen check tie from Fort Belvedere" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Black-and-white-glencheck.jpg" style="height:423px; width:564px" /></p>

<p>A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/accessories/ties/prince-wales-check-silk-tie-handmade-black-white">black and white glen check tie from Fort Belvedere</a></p>

<h4>Add Pattern and Texture</h4>

<p>Beyond avoiding sharp contrast, try adding complexity and interest to your blue and gray combinations by introducing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/outfit-textures/">textures</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/pattern-matching-good-taste-test/">patterns</a>. Sure, you can start simply with a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/the-shirt-style-guide/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Men’s Dress Shirt Style Guide – How To select Fit, Collar, Cuffs &amp; More">white shirt</a>, solid tie, and a plain&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/worsted-wool-suiting-guide/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Worsted Wool Suiting Guide">worsted wool</a>&nbsp;suit, but this gets boring fast. An easy way to add a pattern while remaining classic is to use a gray glen check tie in silk (or wool for winter) with a navy suit. For a gray suit, get a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/grenadine-silk-tie-navy-fort-belvedere" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Fort Belvedere navy grenadine tie">navy grenadine tie</a>&nbsp;in either a large or fine weave (<em>garza grossa</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>garza</em>&nbsp;<em>fina</em>) to inject texture.&nbsp;In the reverse scenario, pick up a silver grenadine for a blue suit.</p>

<p><img alt="A classic Navy grenadine tie from Fort Belvedere" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/navy-grenadine.jpg" style="height:423px; width:564px" /></p>

<h4>Use Items with Both Colors Together</h4>

<p>The most sophisticated method to combine gray and blue with a suit and tie, however, is to choose items that contain both colors together. For example, you can&nbsp;wear a navy suit with a gray&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/grids-plaids-windowpanes/">windowpane</a>&nbsp;pattern. By definition, Prince of Wales suiting fabric differs from a glen check because it contains an overcheck in an additional color, and a common version of this is a gray base pattern with the addition of a blue overcheck, giving you both in one shot.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Prince-of-Wales.jpg"><img alt="An example of Prince of Wales suiting fabric from Sartoria Rossi showing a gray base pattern with blue overplaid." src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Prince-of-Wales.jpg" style="height:720px; width:720px" /></a></p>

<p>Printed silk ties with blue and gray geometric patterns or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/accessories/ties/knit-tie-wool-herringbone-dark-grey-navy-fort-belvedere" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Fort Belvedere Knit Tie in Dark Grey - Navy Wool Herringbone">knit ties with both colors in them</a>&nbsp;are likewise excellent options. I especially like the versatility of striped ties with either a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/essential-ties-every-man-should-invest-in/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Striped ties can combine both blue and gray">repp</a>&nbsp;pattern or large block stripes for this purpose. If you get a tie with stripes of both colors you can wear them easily with either gray or blue suits.</p>

<h3>Gray and Blue with Odd Combinations</h3>

<p>The same techniques mentioned above can be used when wearing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/summer-sport-coat-8-secrets/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="8 Secrets Of A Great Summer Sport Coat">sports coat</a>&nbsp;and trouser combinations, though some men may be put off by the perceived difficulties of coordinating an additional article of clothing:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/should-men-wear-pleated-pants/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Should Men Wear Pleated Pants?">pants</a>&nbsp;in a different shade. If you begin with blue and gray, this is actually a piece of cake. Like the navy suit,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/navy-blazer-striped-club-guide/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Gentleman\'s Gazette blazer guide">the navy blazer</a>&nbsp;is a staple, foundational item of menswear. Technically, a solid blazer has to be blue, so begin there and add gray pants.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Andreas-Weinas.jpg"><img alt="Andreas Weinås doesn\'t look like a security guard in this combination of navy and gray." src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Andreas-Weinas.jpg" style="height:704px; width:564px" /></a></p>

<p>Andreas Wein&aring;s doesn&rsquo;t look like a security guard in this combination of navy and gray.</p>

<p>You may have heard that the classic navy jacket and gray trousers will make you look like a security guard, but if you choose an appropriate fit and quality materials that simply won&rsquo;t happen. Just stay away from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/4-biggest-mens-dress-shoe-mistakes/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="The 4 Biggest Men’s Dress Shoe Mistakes &amp; How To Avoid Them">cheap shoes</a>, polyester fabric, and baggy fits, and you&rsquo;ll be fine. Add a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-to-combine-pocket-square-tie-suit-shirt/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="How To Combine a Pocket Square with a Tie, Suit &amp; Shirt">pocket square</a>&nbsp;to the outfit, even a simple&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/accessories/pocket-square-handkerchief/white-pocket-square-initial-linen-handmade" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">white linen</a>&nbsp;one, and there&rsquo;s no way your outfit will be mistaken for a uniform. Wearing a striped shirt or tie that isn&rsquo;t plain, including the aforementioned navy or silver&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/all-about-grenadine/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="">grenadine</a>, will elevate the look as well.</p>

<p><img alt="Blue blazer with gray trousers" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Blue-blazer-with-gray-trousers-2.jpg" style="height:668px; width:564px" /></p>

<p>A rich navy blue double-breasted suit jacket with gray trousers</p>

<p>The opposite move&ndash;a gray sports coat with navy trousers&ndash;is rarer, maybe because it is generally more difficult to pull off a lighter jacket with darker&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-pants-should-fit/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="How Pants Should Fit">pants</a>. However, there&rsquo;s no reason to be dissuaded, as long as your blue pants don&rsquo;t look like the bottom half of a suit. Here, a pattern can be your friend and using a gray sports coat that contains a pattern, again the classic glen check or Prince of Wales, will enhance your chances of success.</p>

<h3>Multiple Layers of Blue and Gray</h3>

<p>Going beyond the basics, you can use the principles in our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-to-layer-clothes/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Layering 101 guide">Layering 101</a>&nbsp;guide to increase the sophistication of your gray and blue combinations.&nbsp; When we talk about layering we immediately think knitwear and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-to-buy-an-overcoat/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="How To Buy An Overcoat">overcoats</a>&nbsp;for colder weather.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/gray-jacket-with-blue-knitwear.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/gray-jacket-with-blue-knitwear.jpg" style="height:564px; width:564px" /></a></p>

<p>These provide great opportunities to add either alternating layers of blue and gray hues&ndash;like a navy tie, gray&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/the-sweater-guide/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="The Sweater Guide">sweater</a>&nbsp;vest, and navy jacket&ndash;or a swath of the same color&ndash;like a navy blue tie, cardigan, and pants under a gray&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/flannel-guide-fall-fabric/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="FLANNEL – The Original Woolen Fall Fabric">flannel</a>&nbsp;sports coat. You can do the same with a gray or blue overcoat too: decide whether you want to duplicate the underlying color or contrast it, then get creative.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/navy-jacket-with-gray-knitwear.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/navy-jacket-with-gray-knitwear.jpg" style="height:846px; width:564px" /></a></p>

<h3>Gray and Blue Accessories</h3>

<p>Accessories, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-high-end-leather-gloves-are-made/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="How High-End Leather Gloves Are Made">gloves</a>, hats, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/scarf-guide/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Men’s Scarves Guide">scarves</a>, are another great way to use these two colors, and, again, you have two broad options. If you have a gray coat on, you could go monochromatic and select&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/accessories/leather-goods/gloves/peccary-gloves-waterproof-grey-cashmere-lined" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Grey cashmere-lined peccary leather gloves from Fort Belvedere">elegant gray cashmere-lined peccary gloves</a>&nbsp;to match tones. Alternatively, go with a contrast and choose a pair of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/petrol-blue-gloves-button-lamb-nappa-cashmere-fort-belvedere" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Petrol blue leather gloves from Fort Belvedere">bold petrol blue leather gloves</a>&nbsp;in lamb nappa leather. With a scarf, you may be able to &ldquo;kill two birds with one stone&rdquo; by purchasing a double-sided version, like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/accessories/scarves/alpaca-scarf-double-sided-blue-grey-fort-belvedere" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Double Sided Alpaca Scarf in Dark Blue and Grey">this dark blue and gray one</a>&nbsp;in alpaca from Fort Belvedere, which lets you contrast or blend with a flip of the cloth.</p>

<p>An overlooked accessory that&rsquo;s especially great for warmer weather is a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/accessories/boutonnieres" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">boutonniere</a>. You won&rsquo;t find a gray flower, even in nature, but you can definitely pop a realistic silk&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/accessories/boutonnieres/cornflower-boutonniere-blue-silk-buttonhole-flower-fort-belvedere" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Blue Cornflower Blue Boutonniere from Fort Belvedere">blue cornflower boutonniere</a>&nbsp;into the lapel buttonhole of your gray suit jacket to bring on the spring.</p>

<h3>Blue and Gray Shoes and Socks</h3>

<p>Although blue and gray is usually a conservative combination, one of the boldest things you can do for your overall outfit is&nbsp;to wear these colors as footwear.

<p>In terms of availability, your best bet for blue shoes might be navy&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/loafer-guide-penny-gucci-tassels-weejuns/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="The Ultimate Loafer Shoes Guide For Men">loafers</a>, which are most often found in suede, though polished calf leather makes for a more formal choice, perhaps with gray trousers and a sports coat. Pairing blue shoes of any sort with blue pants are trickier but possible if both colors are similar enough.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/blue-suede-loafers.jpg"><img alt="Blue calf leather loafers with navy pants" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/blue-suede-loafers.jpg" style="height:844px; width:564px" /></a></p>

<p>Blue calf leather loafers with navy pants</p>

<p>Those who are truly committed and a bit daring can try to locate&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/spectator-two-tone-shoe-guide/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="The Gentleman\'s Gazette spectator and two-tone shoe guide">spectator shoes</a>&nbsp;that combine both navy and gray. A two-tone shoe is surprisingly versatile because it can accompany tailoring of either color.</p>

<p>Unusual but surprisingly versatile navy and gray brogue wingtips</p>

<p>Solid gray shoes appropriate for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/bespoke-tailoring-basics/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="">tailored clothing</a>&nbsp;are exceedingly rare and tend to be lighter gray monk straps or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/ways-to-lace-shoes/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Ways To Lace Shoes – The Derby Shoe">derbies</a>. Thus, they&rsquo;re awkward for navy trousers due to the high contrast they create, and wearing them with gray could create too much uniformity in your outfit. However, you could always experiment if you find a pair. Something with two tones of gray or just dark gray would be more useful.</p>

<p>If you aren&rsquo;t ready to make the leap to blue or gray shoes, a unique and inexpensive option that will also brighten things up is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/accessories/shoelaces" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Fort Belvedere shoelaces">shoelaces</a>&nbsp;in one of these classic colors. For around $10, you can put gray laces on black oxfords to be worn with a grey suit or blue laces on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-to-wear-brown-shoes-boots-men/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="">brown shoes</a>&nbsp;with a navy suit.</p>

<p>Socks are also a terrific option to coordinate blue and gray.

You can show some panache by wearing socks that contain the complementary color to your pants (for example, blue socks with gray trousers ) or, better yet, socks that contain both colors, like a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/accessories/socks/shadow-stripe-socks-ribbed-cotton-light-grey-blue-fort-belvedere" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Fort Belvedere Light Grey and Light Blue Shadow Stripe Socks">light blue and light gray shadow stripe</a>.</p>

<h3>Blue and Gray for Casual Wear</h3>

<p>Though the Gentleman&rsquo;s Gazette focuses on classic style, we&rsquo;d be remiss not to mention the most popular article of casual clothing and probably the most popular blue fabric worn throughout the world&ndash;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/denim-jeans-guide/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="The Denim Jeans Guide">denim</a>. We don&rsquo;t specifically think of wearing gray with denim, but maybe we should take this page out of the classic menswear book and apply it to casual wear too.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/best-jeans-body-type/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="">Blue jeans</a>&nbsp;can easily be paired with a gray sports coat, provided the jeans are not overly distressed and the jacket casual enough, like something in an unstructured cotton or with sufficient texture.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Blue-jeans-with-gray.jpg"><img alt="Atte Rytkönen from Dress Like A with jeans and a gray jacket." src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Blue-jeans-with-gray-705x1030.jpg" style="height:1030px; width:705px" /></a></p>

<p>Blue&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-wear-denim-shirt/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">denim shirts</a>&nbsp;have recently become a popular transitional garment, worn instead of dressier shirts with sports coats. Add a navy jacket, gray pants, and the aforementioned blue loafers, and you have a fantastic outfit.</p>',

Even though there are entire blogs and channels dedicated to the style of James Bond, it&rsquo;s not that easy to copy his look because on the one hand, you need a lot of dough, and on the other hand, you may not look like James Bond.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Just because an outfit works well for 007, doesn&rsquo;t mean it will work well for you, and your style, and your surroundings. At the Gentleman&rsquo;s Gazette, we think it makes more sense to figure out what style rules Bond abides by and then use those to adapt them to your unique situations rather than just copying him to the tee.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xsZ5QBGkWfo/hqdefault.jpg" style="height:360px; width:480px" /></p>

<h2>The Evolution of Agent 007&rsquo;s Style</h2>

<p>Agent 007 has been on film since 1962 when Sean Connery embodied Bond in Doctor No. Bond is now entering his seventh decade at Hollywood and as you can imagine, his style has changed quite a bit throughout the years. Bond has worn everything from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/dinner-jacket-black-tie-guide/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="">dinner jackets</a>&nbsp;to traditional tuxedos, Scottish Highland dress, formal&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/morning-dress-dress-code/">morning dress</a>, as well as one-piece ski suits in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-wear-yellow-menswear/">yellow</a>, as well as tropical shirts.</p>

<p>While James bond was a fan of disguises, which luckily the current one is not really a fan of anymore, instead he has developed a sartorial reputation that shows him as being effortlessly dapper at all times, always prepared for the situation, and dress appropriately. And of course, Bond has worn many bad outfits and admiring them or imitating them is just not stylish at all. For example, in the 1970s, it was, in general, a really dark era for classic men&rsquo;s style and fashion and that was also true for Bond.</p>

<p>Ian Fleming&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/literary-james-bond-original-007/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="">literary James Bond</a>&nbsp;was not nearly as stylish as he is made out to be today. Of course, over the course of two dozens of Bond films, different costume designers and choreographers have changed the way he looked. On top of that, product placements play a much bigger role today than they used to be 40 years ago. So just because Bond now drinks Heineken and shaves with a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/the-gillette-ad-and-the-modern-gentleman/">Gillette</a>, doesn&rsquo;t mean that you should.</p>

<p>Daniel Craig has been playing Bond since 2006 and he definitely has brought him into a new era of Bond style.</p>

<h2>What Are James Bond&rsquo;s Style Rules?</h2>

<p>Even though we think it&rsquo;s impossible to distill the James Bond-style down to one single concept, we came up with 11 rules that we think he lives by.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Daniel-Craig-as-James-Bond-in-black-suit.jpg"><img alt="Daniel Craig as James Bond in black suit" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Daniel-Craig-as-James-Bond-in-black-suit-1030x1030.jpg" style="height:1030px; width:1030px" /></a></p>

<h2>1. He Respects The Power and Style Of Clothes</h2>

<p>Obviously, Bond is an intense character who&rsquo;s more a man of action rather than words. As such, his clothes are an important part of who he is and how he wants to be perceived.</p>

<p>In the 2006 Casino Royale movie, we can see that Bond utilizes his clothes as a tool. In the opening scene, he wears a tropical shirt whereas later in the movies, Vesper comments on his disdain for the suit and later on, he changes his dinner jacket for a traditional&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/tuxedo-black-tie-guide/advanced/james-bond-tuxedo/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="">tuxedo</a>. By the end of the movie, Bond is embracing the power of clothes, wearing a three-piece&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-many-suits-does-a-man-need/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="">suit</a>&nbsp;for his final show of power. There&rsquo;s no real purpose for this outfit other than showing that Bond has fully grasped the power of clothes and his new identity. Bond fully understands that great clothes, especially more formal ones such as a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-to-pair-shirts-ties-with-blue-suits/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="">suit</a>, add to his air of competence and authority. He fully understands that he&rsquo;s not going to earn respect or elicit fear if he&rsquo;s dressed like the average American suburban dad.</p>

<h2>2. He Knows What Works for Him and Sticks With It</h2>

<p>What does that mean? Well, he expects his garments to perform and so he doesn&rsquo;t use cheap substitutes. He also keeps his color palette somewhat limited to keep a harmonious look that is somewhat of a signature for him.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/James-Bond-in-brown-sahntung-silk-Nehru-jacket.webp"><img alt="James Bond in brown sahntung silk Nehru jacket" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/James-Bond-in-brown-sahntung-silk-Nehru-jacket-900x898.webp" style="height:898px; width:900px" /></a></p>

<h2>3. Bond&rsquo;s Style Never Overshadows Him</h2>

<p>The same is true for you, the clothes shouldn&rsquo;t be wearing you, you should be wearing your clothes. That means the clothes shouldn&rsquo;t be so bold that they overshadow your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/10-ways-to-find-your-personal-style/">personality</a>. Bond has understood that and he keeps it simple. Bond sticks with muted colors, white shirts, subtle&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/pattern-matching-good-taste-test/">patterns</a>, and nothing is overdone. Obviously, his style is deliberately not flashy at all.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Tom-Ford-suits-in-James-Bond-films.webp"><img alt="Tom Ford suits in James Bond films" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Tom-Ford-suits-in-James-Bond-films-900x600.webp" style="height:600px; width:900px" /></a></p>

<h2>4. Bond Moves With The Times But Leans Into Classics</h2>

<p>Fashion has changed radically since 1962 and every Bond has found a way to move with the fashions. Roger Moore wore a safari suit and flared&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/features-of-a-pair-of-pants/">pants</a>&nbsp;in the 1970s, Pierce Brosnan&rsquo;s Brioni suits and jackets lean more into the looser fit of the 90s versus Daniel Craig in the 2000s used&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/gentleman-style-tom-ford/">Tom Ford</a>&nbsp;suits with a slimmer and trimmer silhouette. So even though Bond goes with the time, certain elements like the classic suit are always part of his repertoire.</p>

<p>The same is true for you, you don&rsquo;t have to buy period garments but you can buy items that you can wear now or 20 or 30 years from now because they&rsquo;re subtle in the pattern and they&rsquo;re not flashy and you can just wear them all the time.</p>

<h2>5. You Don&rsquo;t Have To Stick To Bones Color Palette</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;re into clothes and you like to play with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-to-use-the-color-wheel-to-assemble-superior-outfits/">colors</a>, you can certainly explore a little more, all that matters is that you find something that works for you. For example, I&rsquo;m a clotheshorse and I have all kinds of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-match-colors-patterns/">different patterns and colors</a>&nbsp;in my wardrobe but when I wear them, I try to do so sparingly and not everything at once. No matter what your style is, you should never look like you&rsquo;re trying too hard and it&rsquo;s exactly what James Bond is good at.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Turnbull-James-Bond.jpg"><img alt="Sean Connery wearing a signature T&amp;A shirt" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Turnbull-James-Bond-1030x694.jpg" style="height:694px; width:1030px" /></a></p>

<h2>6. Functional Wear Doesn&rsquo;t Mean Athleisure</h2>

<p>Bond is always on the run yet you never see him in Lululemon pants. He&rsquo; still manages to be 007 agent despite wearing the clothes he chose which are more in a foreign side. Bond sometimes chases terrorists in a suit and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/oxford-shoes-guide/">Oxfords</a>, I am, by no means, suggesting that you should wear a suit to the gym or go fishing. At the same time, please understand that just because you do something that is functional, doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to resort to athleisure wear. In the same vein, you don&rsquo;t always have to wear&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/should-you-wear-sneakers/">sneakers</a>, a well-fitting pair of leather&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/men-dress-shoes-must-haves/">dress shoes</a>&nbsp;will do the job and they look stylish too.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Roger-Moore-as-Bond-in-Moonraker-wearing-a-Donegal-Tweed-Suit-note-his-digital-watch.jpg"><img alt="Roger Moore as Bond in Moonraker wearing a Donegal Tweed Suit - note his digital watch" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Roger-Moore-as-Bond-in-Moonraker-wearing-a-Donegal-Tweed-Suit-note-his-digital-watch-1030x699.jpg" style="height:699px; width:1030px" /></a></p>

<h2>7. Know The Style Rules (Then Break Them As They Suit You)</h2>

<p>Bond definitely breaks certain style rules and we don&rsquo;t suggest you make all of them but still, knowing what it is and then intentionally deciding not to follow it is much better than not having a clue in the first place. For example, Bond wears&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/accessories/ties/knit-ties" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="">knit ties</a>&nbsp;with formal dark suits. 20 years ago, people would have maybe thought of that as being incorrect but in this day and age, it&rsquo;s ok to add a more casual tie with more texture to the otherwise classic&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/combine-shoes-boots-suits/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="">business suit</a>. On the other hand, the new Bond sometimes wears a three-piece suit with a belt which is obviously wrong because it makes your vest bunch up in the front so a pair of suspenders or side adjusters in your pants are preferable.</p>

<p>Personally, I think it&rsquo;s just the costume designer who doesn&rsquo;t pay attention but at the end of the day, it still reflects the Bond style. For example, look at Bond&rsquo;s watch selection, he pretty much wears&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/sports-watches-for-men/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="">sports watches</a>&nbsp;exclusively even with his tuxedo. That decision is not so much driven by his style, I think, rather than the product placement and if companies pay a lot and their bestsellers are sports watches, that&rsquo;s what they want Bond to wear.</p>

<p>That being said, his status as a special agent makes it more suitable for him to wear a sports watch that needs to perform at all times. He also wears a lot of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/monochromatic-outfits/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="">black on black</a>&nbsp;which makes his character recede sometimes into a background which again, for his role and be advantageous but in general,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/black-suits-for-men/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="">black</a>&nbsp;and menswear is one of the most overrated colors. On occasion, Bond also skips the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/tuxedo-black-tie-guide/classic/evening-waistcoat-vest-cummerbund/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="">waistcoat</a>&nbsp;with a single-breasted tuxedo which is not the norm even though more and more people are doing it in Hollywood these days. It doesn&rsquo;t mean it favors your look simply because an exposed waistband just looks unfinished.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>8. Dress For The Occasion</h2>

<p>Bond is typically well attired. He wears a tuxedo when it calls for it, he wears a suit when he shows up at MI6, and he wears a down&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/tuxedo-black-tie-guide/advanced/smoking-jacket-guide/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="">jacket</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-to-wear-boots-102/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="">boots</a>&nbsp;when it&rsquo;s cold outside. Understanding your surroundings and the purpose of your clothes always help you to dress through the right level, depending on your occasion.</p>

<h2>9. The Basics Will Always Look Good</h2>

<p>Whether it&rsquo;s a pair of dark&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/denim-jeans-guide/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="">denim</a>, a dark suit, a white&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/the-shirt-style-guide/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="">shirt</a>, a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/accessories/pocket-square-handkerchief/pocket-square-white-irish-linen-initial-monogram-fort-belvedere" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="">white pocket square</a>&nbsp;or a knit tie, these are all staples in your wardrobe that you can combine with lots of different outfits and they work for Bond and they will work for you too. Why? Well, all these are classics that have stood the test of time, they have been around for a while and they will be around for a while and Bond fully embraces that.</p>

<h2>10. When In Doubt, Wear A Jacket</h2>

<p>I would say that Bond, more often than not, wears a jacket, whether it&rsquo;s a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/suit-jackets-sport-coats-and-blazers-whats-the-difference/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="">suit jacket, a blazer, a sport coat</a>, a safari jacket or maybe a down jacket. He just wears something because it pulls his looks together and he&rsquo;s more complete that way.</p>

<h2>11. James Bond Embraces The Suit</h2>

<p>In 2020,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/is-the-suit-dying/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="">the suit is, in many ways, dying</a>&nbsp;as a requirement in the workplace and people don&rsquo;t have to wear the suit anymore. At the same time, James Bond chooses to wear it because it gives him dignity, authority, and competence. Bond chooses to wear the suit because it&rsquo;s the classic hyper masculine garment that communicates power and authority, at the same time, he wears it because it makes him feel good and respected. The same is true for you. If you like the way&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/the-anatomy-suit-jacket/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="">suits</a>&nbsp;make you feel and be perceived, then by all means, go ahead and wear them even though people around you may not wear them anymore.</p>',

<p><img alt="" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/o9jZYFZT7Jo/hqdefault.jpg" style="height:360px; width:480px" /></p>

<p>Our primary mission here at the Gentleman&rsquo;s Gazette is to educate our audience about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/gentleman-what-it-means-today/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">what it means to be a Gentleman</a>. And a big portion of that has to do with the history and traditions of classic menswear. Often when men are discussing these menswear traditions their conversation can come to be framed in terms of style rules that must be followed at all costs. While we certainly do believe that there are&nbsp;great&nbsp;many pieces of advice that are rooted in sound logic and the principles of aesthetics, thinking always in terms of ironclad rules that have to be followed is simplistic and pedantic and limits your options in terms of what you can wear stylishly. In other words, you don&rsquo;t have to think of some of these things as rules that have to be followed a hundred percent of the time and some of the things we&rsquo;re going to mention today can just be discarded altogether.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-01-at-11.44.34-PM-1030x559.png" /></p>

<p>With that said, here are some supposed rules or pieces of advice that we think can be bent, broken or just left aside. These aren&rsquo;t necessarily in any particular order of importance but we&rsquo;ve numbered them today just to keep things consistent.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Fit-is-important-1030x563.png" /></p>

<p>Fit is important</p>

<h2>1. Wear A Suit And Look Fantastic</h2>

<p>Advice number one, just wear a suit and you&rsquo;ll automatically look fantastic. While this piece of advice does advocate for dressing up which of course we support, it&rsquo;s a little bit too simplistic in nature. As we&rsquo;ve said countless times before in the channel,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-a-suit-should-fit/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">fit</a>&nbsp;is the most important factor when wearing any outfit. You may have a suit that&rsquo;s constructed from the most luxurious materials available but if it doesn&rsquo;t fit your frame properly it&rsquo;s still going to look sloppy.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-01-at-11.49.24-PM-1030x538.png" /></p>

<p>Quantity does not equal Quality</p>

<h2>2. More Clothes, The Better / If It&rsquo;s On Sale, Buy It</h2>

<p>Two closely related tips, the more clothes you have in your closet the better and if it&rsquo;s on sale in a store, buy it. Here&rsquo;s the thing about these two related pieces of advice. Ultimately, quantity does not equal quality. You don&rsquo;t need to have a pair of pants in every color under the sun or a jacket for each day of the month in your closet. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with having options, of course, but having a modestly sized closet full of garments that you wear regularly and that look good on you will ultimately serve you just as well if not better than having an excess of options. This dovetails into another tip don&rsquo;t buy something you&rsquo;re not going to wear. Even if you see a deal in a store and it&rsquo;s 90% off, if you don&rsquo;t think the garment in question is one that&rsquo;s going to look good on you or one that won&rsquo;t harmonize with other pieces in your wardrobe, don&rsquo;t buy it. Save your money however small the amount may be for something that you will wear regularly.</p>

<h2>3. Expensive = High Quality / Buy Only Name Brand Items</h2>

<p>Another two closely related tips, if something is expensive it must be of high quality and you should only buy name-brand items. These are sort of the reverse of the tip about items being on sale. Just because something is very expensive or has a brand name associated with it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that it&rsquo;s high quality. Oftentimes you&rsquo;re really just going to be paying the extra money for the brand name itself. Whenever you&rsquo;re buying any garment your primary focus should be on the quality of construction, the materials used and whether that garment in question will work well with other pieces in your wardrobe.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Follow-the-trend-1030x531.png" /></p>

<p>Trends are trends for a reason</p>

<h2>4. Follow The Current Trends</h2>

<p>An easy way to get started with dressing better is to follow some of the current trends that are going on. It&rsquo;s never a bad thing to want to upgrade your personal style unless you&rsquo;re just doing it for superficial reasons or to fish for compliments. If you go out and buy a bunch of items of clothing that are trendy at the moment chances are that they&rsquo;re probably going to be out of fashion in a year or maybe even less time. After all, trends are trends for a reason. Instead just invest in quality garments that follow these solid principles of aesthetics: fit, function,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-to-use-the-color-wheel-to-assemble-superior-outfits/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">color theory</a>&nbsp;and so on. If you do this, people&rsquo;s compliments about your improving style will be genuine as will their respect.</p>

<h2>5. Outfits Should Match / Black And Brown Don&rsquo;t Go Together</h2>

<p>A general tip and a more specific tip, everything in your outfit should match and more specifically that you can&rsquo;t wear black and brown together. People often advocate for a monochromatic look because it&rsquo;s a relatively safe way of looking put together after all you won&rsquo;t have any wildly clashing colors if you&rsquo;re wearing all the same color. Similarly, people say that black and brown are too fundamentally different in terms of formality to be paired together both of these tips require a bit more nuance to be helpful.</p>

<p>First of all, not every article of clothing in your outfit has to match exactly. The thing you should be shooting for is for all of your garments to harmonize in a way that&rsquo;s aesthetically pleasing. For example, you could be wearing an all-black outfit but keep in mind that there are subtle variations in shades of black between different garments of different fabrics and with different dyes and so on. And if some of these&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/the-most-overrated-color-black/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">blacks</a>&nbsp;in your clothes are looking almost the same but not quite this can be jarring to the eye. And it might have been a better decision to wear something in different colors that harmonized well. Similarly, black and brown can absolutely be worn together if the garments in question harmonize in terms of intensity and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/the-formality-scale-how/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">formality</a>.</p>

<h2>6. Advice On Fit</h2>

<p>Pieces of advice on fit. Things like you should wear all slim fit clothing if you want to look&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/style-guide-for-slim-men/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">thinner</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/suits-for-big-men/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">larger</a>&nbsp;men should only wear clothing that&rsquo;s&nbsp;more roomy. The bottom line with any advice in terms of fit is this. Properly fitted garments are ones that are proportional to your individual frame and thus that flatter you well. As an example, if a larger man is wearing slim fit clothing in order to look thinner but the garments are actually too tight on him, all of the wrinkling and tugging in different places around the outfit is just going to make him look too big for his clothing. On the other hand, a big man who has too much fabric on his frame is just going to look like a tent. Any well fitting article of clothing on you should be just loose enough to be comfortable and let you be mobile but still fitted enough so that it&rsquo;s not billowing, sagging, dragging, or so on.</p>

<h2>7. Old Chestnuts About What Not To Wear</h2>

<p>Some old chestnuts about what to&nbsp;wear-when. Like no wearing white after Labor Day, no wearing white before Memorial Day or no Brown in town. All of these supposed rules are entirely antiquated today. They got their start in the 19th century as a way for the old money aristocracy to easily socially separate themselves from the new money or nouveau riche as well as the lower classes. These old sayings are just rooted in classism and social stratification and as such, they really don&rsquo;t have any place in the 21st century. While it is true that some informally styled brown suits or other brown ensembles aren&rsquo;t totally appropriate for traditional white-collar business settings even this is starting to change to some extent.</p>

<p>In the broad-strokes for all of these tips however just remember that if it looks good on you you can wear it at any time.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Tie-as-a-a-belt-1030x556.png" /></p>

<p>Wearing a tie as a belt</p>

<h2>8. Trousers With Belt Loops Needs A Belt</h2>

<p>If your trousers have belt loops, you have to wear a belt. This tip comes from the fact that above all, most men&rsquo;s clothing really is rooted in purpose and utility. Belt loops are another similarly utilitarian feature. After all, belts are designed to hold up your trousers but they were also historically used to carry things for men who were working. Because this use for belts is really only confined to a few industries or applications these days, you won&rsquo;t see belts in as many situations. And think of it this way, if your trousers are really fitting properly you won&rsquo;t absolutely have to have a belt to hold them up. As such you&rsquo;ve got a variety of options for how to keep your trousers up whether or not they have belt loops. You could wear suspenders if your trousers also have suspender buttons. You could use side adjusters if your trousers have both loops and adjusters. You could use an old tie as a belt if you wanted to go for an especially casual look or yes you could go beltless. Ultimately, you just have to keep in mind the level of formality of the outfit you&rsquo;re trying to assemble.</p>

<h2>9. Leather And Metals Must&nbsp;Match</h2>

<p>You always have to match the leathers and the metals in your outfits. This guideline is designed to help men who are just starting out with the principles of classic style to assemble outfits that are more harmonious. And while it&rsquo;s never going to look bad if you match the metals or the leathers in your outfit you can also be tasteful about bending this rule. For example, you could be wearing gold&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-to-combine-cuff-links/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">cufflinks</a>&nbsp;and a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/11-rules-of-the-watch/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">watch</a>&nbsp;with a subtle and tasteful silver case or you could be wearing a darker brown belt with slightly lighter brown shoes. In either of these cases, no one is going to arrest you if you try to wear these items together. The key with pairing any articles of clothing is to make sure that no single element of your outfit is overpowering. As long as everything is working in harmony together and your elements are tasteful, you can go ahead and wear slightly different metals or leathers in the same outfit. With that said there are certain metallic tones and leather colors that harmonize better with specific&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-to-find-colors-for-skintone/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">skin tones</a>.</p>

<h2>10. Always Match Your Socks To Your Pants Or Shoes</h2>

<p>You should always&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-to-combine-socks-shoes-pants/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">match your socks</a>&nbsp;to either your pants or your shoes. This one has its roots and aesthetics basically the thinking is that if you match the color of your socks to the color of your shoes, your leg line is going to be broken up when you sit down or when your socks are otherwise exposed. Similarly, if you match the color of your socks to that of your pants, your leg line is always going to look longer. And while these two fundamental rules are true and sound, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that you always have to feel like your socks should match your pants directly. After all, there&rsquo;s been an ongoing trend over the last few decades for more&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/should-you-wear-crazy-socks/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">crazy and colorful socks</a>. And while we don&rsquo;t necessarily advocate for socks that are really out there, you can feel free to wear them if you think they work with your casual outfit. Otherwise for a slightly more formal outfit feel free to match your socks to your shirt, your tie, or some other element of your outfit. Again the key here is harmony. It&rsquo;s always going to be&nbsp;safest&nbsp;and most conservative if you match your socks to your pants but you don&rsquo;t have to do so 100% of the time.</p>

<h2>11. Follow The Advice Of Your Favourite Style Site</h2>

<p>And finally, just follow all of the advice of your favorite style Youtubers or authors to the letter and you can&rsquo;t go wrong. Obviously, we here at the Gentleman&rsquo;s Gazette think that we&rsquo;re providing the best advice possible to all men who are looking to upgrade their style. And while we do hope that you&rsquo;ll follow the guidelines we put out. Keep in mind that they are just that guidelines. If you want to experiment to some extent to find your own personal style and expression, go ahead and do so! After all, at the end of the day, you are you and you can express your individuality however you so choose.</p>

<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s helpful to think of the principles of classic menswear more as guidelines and guardrails than hard and fast rules. Some of these can be bent some of them can be broken from time to time and some of them can be discarded completely. If you&rsquo;re just starting out on your menswear journey it can be helpful to follow some of these pieces of advice more closely so that you won&rsquo;t be making grave mistakes. As you become more experienced however by knowing more of these guidelines you&rsquo;ll be able to break them tastefully.</p>

<h2>7 must-have accessories for summer</h2>

<h3>1. Fabric Belt</h3>

<p>Our first pick today might surprise you, because it&rsquo;s usually not top-of-mind for most men: a woven or fabric belt. It&rsquo;s one of the most casual belt options out there and because of that, they really suit summer&rsquo;s relaxed, casual vibe. Woven leather or fabric belts are the best companion for your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/boat-shoes-guide-buy-style-history-care/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">boat shoes</a>, your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/summer-shorts-guide/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">shorts</a>, your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/seersucker-fabric-suits-origins/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">seersuckers</a>, and any other summer garment out there.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Madras-Belt-ideal-for-a-seersucker-outfit.webp"><img alt="Madras Belt - ideal for a seersucker outfit" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Madras-Belt-ideal-for-a-seersucker-outfit-900x673.webp" /></a></p>

<p>Madras Belt &ndash; ideal for a seersucker outfit</p>

<p>Of course, the classic rule is to always match the color of your belt to your shoes, but during&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/10-essential-menswear-items-for-summer/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">summer</a>, you can be a little more creative; maybe wear something like a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/madras-guide-shirts-pants-history-where-to-buy/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">madras</a>&nbsp;belt, which is very contrasting but suits the outfit, makes it more casual, and is very summery. The contrast is intended, and if you don&rsquo;t want to wear colorful belts to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/the-well-appointed-office/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">office</a>, just go with a simple woven leather belt.</p>

<p><img alt="A group of preppy belts" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/A-group-of-preppy-belts-900x675.webp" /></p>

<p>A group of preppy belts</p>

<p>Apart from woven leather belts, you can also find woven fabric belts that are stiff and woven elastic belts that are flexible. They often come in two tones or in a single light&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-to-use-the-color-wheel-to-assemble-superior-outfits/">color</a>. It&rsquo;s fun to experiment with such belts, especially since they have different leather accents and gold or silver hardware. In regard to fabric belts, there are a number of different styles; for example, you can find leather belts that are covered with a fabric such as madras.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can find a stiff fabric belt that has kind of a woven, tie-like material put on top, or something like a neeedlepoint belt. All of these options are a little more&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/the-preppy-style-primer/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">preppy</a>, sometimes they have the emblem of a club or little anchors for a more nautical themed look. Personally, we think it&rsquo;s a great way to personalize your outfit in a subtle way that doesn&rsquo;t go overboard.</p>

<h3>2. Anything Linen</h3>

<p>Linen is a classic&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/summer-fabrics-revisited/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">summer fabric</a>. Why? Because it has an open weave, it wrinkles in a casual way, and the fibers themselves are a little bit irregular making it all more casual, and therefore, well suited for summer. On top of that, it&rsquo;s often lightweight and the more you wear it and wash it, the softer it gets&ndash;so it&rsquo;s super comfortable. Some may argue that it looks a bit unkempt, yet the wrinkling is part of the fabric and it&rsquo;s a desired side-effect&ndash;unlike, let&rsquo;s say, with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/cotton-explained/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">cotton</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wool-explained/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">wool</a>&nbsp;suits. Of course, linen comes in different weights and weaves but for summer, you want something that has a lightweight, open weave so you can feel every breeze. At the Gentleman&rsquo;s Gazette, we&rsquo;re big proponents of wearing linen for your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/the-anatomy-suit-jacket/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">suit jackets</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/features-of-a-pair-of-pants/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">pants</a>, but if that&rsquo;s a little much for you, maybe just incorporate it into your accessories.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/accessories/ties/wool-linen-blend-tie-solid-orange-fort-belvedere" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Wool Linen Tie in Textured Orange - Fort Belvedere" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Wool-Linen-Tie-in-Textured-Orange-Fort-Belvedere-1030x688.jpg" /></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/accessories/ties/wool-linen-blend-tie-solid-orange-fort-belvedere" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Wool Linen Tie in Textured Orange &ndash; Fort Belvedere</a></p>

<p>First of all, consider linen or linen blends for your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/accessories/ties/ties-3-fold/ties-linen" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">neckties</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/accessories/bow-ties/bow-ties-linen" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">bow ties</a>. Linen ties often have a white warp or weft color that&rsquo;s combined with a different color. Because of that, you get a light, summery color tone rather than something dark which would be better suited for the colder months of the year. Soft pastel colors such as orange,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-wear-pink-menswear/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">pink</a>, olive green, or sky blue are perfect tie colors. You frame those ties with a lighter-colored jacket and shirt, and they fit right in&ndash;whereas during the winter, they will just stand out too much.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/accessories/pocket-square-handkerchief/white-pocket-square-initial-linen-handmade" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="White linen pocket square with monogram" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/White-linen-pocket-square-with-monogram-687x1030.jpg" style="height:1030px; width:687px" /></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/accessories/pocket-square-handkerchief/white-pocket-square-initial-linen-handmade" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">White linen pocket square with monogram</a></p>

<p>Of course, if it&rsquo;sreally hot, you can&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/should-you-wear-jacket-without-tie/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">skip the neckwear</a>&nbsp;and go with a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/accessories/pocket-square-handkerchief/pocket-square-white-irish-linen-initial-monogram-fort-belvedere">linen pocket square</a>. It just takes 10 seconds to fold one, yet it really upgrades your entire look. The all-time classic is the white linen pocket square. Of course, the edges should always be handrolled so you can&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-to-fold-a-pocket-square/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">fold a crown</a>&nbsp;or something else that reveals that this is a piece of art made by a true artisan. While the white linen pocket square is extremely versatile (it can work with a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/dress-code-business-attire/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">business suit</a>, for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/tuxedo-black-tie-guide/etiquette/black-tie-dress-code/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">black-tie</a>, or with a summer ensemble), it&rsquo;s really fun to add a bit of color to your linen pocket squares, as well.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/accessories/pocket-square-handkerchief/light-blue-linen-pocket-square-yellow-x-stitches-fort-belvedere" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Light Blue Linen Pocket Square with Yellow Handrolled X Stitch - Fort Belvedere" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Light-Blue-Linen-Pocket-Square-with-Yellow-Handrolled-X-Stitch-Fort-Belvedere-1030x687.jpg" /></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/accessories/pocket-square-handkerchief/light-blue-linen-pocket-square-yellow-x-stitches-fort-belvedere" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Light Blue Linen Pocket Square with Yellow Handrolled X Stitch &ndash; Fort Belvedere</a></p>

<p>For example, if you have a blue and white&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/stripes-menswear-different-types/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">striped shirt</a>, consider wearing it with a white linen pocket square that has a blue contrasting X-stitch, so that you pick up the colors of the shirt in the pocket square and it&rsquo;s all harmonious. Alternatively, you could have a white pocket square with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/accessories/pocket-square-handkerchief/white-linen-pocket-square-blue-polka-dots-spots-fort-belvedere" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">blue hand-embroidered polka dots</a>, or maybe you want to coordinate the pocket square with something else in your outfit. So light pastel colors in blue, red, or yellow are fantastic because they&rsquo;re very summery. Again, just like with the ties, if you have a warp and a weft with one color in white and the other in a different brighter color, it results in a three-dimensional color depth which is very summery and ideal for the warm months of the year. Of course, you can also wear a summery&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/accessories/pocket-square-handkerchief/silk-pocket-squares-handkerchiefs" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">silk pocket square</a>, maybe in white and bolder lighter colors, or perhaps a silk-blend pocket square in an orange color that works well.</p>',

<p>Borsalino Panama Hats in Vibrant Colors</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/panama-hat/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="The Panama Hat">Panama hats&nbsp;</a>have always been a great summer accessory for men, but Borsalino really tries to shake it up a bit by adding different colors and even spotty patterns to its hat portfolio. For example, take a look at this teal colored straw hat with a vibrant red or orange hat ribbon; it is certainly more vibrant than what we have seen in the past from Borsalino.</p>

<p>Also, they now offer two-tone hats as you can see in the picture to the right. Personally, I am not a great fan of the blue / neon green spotted straw hats. Although quite innovative, I think it looks odd. Of course, you can still get the classic Panama hat from Borsalino as well.</p>

<p>Schneider&rsquo;s Salzburg from Austria is traditionally known for its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/overcoat-topcoat-jacket-guide/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Overcoat, Topcoat &amp; Jacket Guide — Gentleman\'s Gazette">overcoats</a>&nbsp;made of&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loden_cape" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Loden fabric</a>, as well as their Tyrolean Tracht. However, they also offer a number of other items, such as trenchcoats and sports jackets. Interestingly, some of the sportscoats featured a pleat behind the armhole, which is not quite a shooting pleat and hence it does not provide much extra movement. Nevertheless, it provides the garment with a special look. www.schneiders.com</p>

<p>Navy Suit with Kent Fasson</p>

<p>I was glad to see a number of jackets that featured the 4&times;1 Kent Fasson. Although not really popular in recent years, I believe it is a great cut that shows more of your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/ties?limit=all" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Ties">tie</a>&nbsp;than traditional single or double breasted jackets. If you are in the market for a new&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/navy-blazer-striped-club-guide/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="The Blazer Guide">blazer</a>, consider the Kent Fasson next season.</p>

<h2>Article &ndash; Apparel Arts 1933</h2>

<blockquote>
<h3>CLOTHES FOR COLLEGE</h3>

<p>IN the Fall a young man&rsquo;s fancy turns to haberdashery rather than Homer, and suits rather than Suetonius. Then the Novum Organum becomes a new world of dress. Back to college&hellip; back among men&hellip; back where clubs and clothes mark a man&rsquo;s standards.</p>

<p>The word &ldquo;collegiate,&rdquo; now seldom used in speaking of college men, is altogether foreign to its famous meaning of some eight years ago, when the raccoon coat, Oxford bags, the hat pushed up in front, and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/socks?limit=all" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Socks">socks</a>&nbsp;rolled down, were all implicit in the term. Today the college man is looked upon as a leader of fashion, a man who dresses inconspicuously and correctly for all occasions, thanks to the leadership of smart Eastern Universities, which have a metropolitan feeling, or at least are near enough to metropolitan areas for the students to feel all the influences of sophisticated living. We can thank the present-day &ldquo;collegiate&rdquo; element for the return to popularity of the tail coat, for the white buckskin shoes, for the gray&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/double-breasted-glen-check-fall-flannelsuit-caraceni/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Flannel">flannel</a>&nbsp;slacks with odd jackets, and for various other smart fashions which are typical of university men today.</p>

<p>For on-campus wear there is a general acceptance of country clothes in the typical British manner, such as odd slacks and tweed jackets, country brogues and felt hats. This is the way the undergraduates at smart Universities and prep schools dress today during classes. Over the week-ends when the average college man goes to town there is always the dark Chesterfield coat and derby hat. Single or double-breasted town suit, black&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/100-vs-500-usd-dress-shoes-men/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="100 USD vs. 500 USD Men’s Dress Shoes – Differences Explained">shoes</a>, very often a white starched collar and a tail coat.</p>

<p>Clothing and furnishings that should be sold to men going to college for the first time or returning to college should be exacting for the very reason that none will find out more quickly what things are wrong than the student himself when he gets to his college.</p>

<p>Smart and new items already having a definite acceptance with University men and which follow Fall fashion trends in all their indications are these: a double breasted suit of dark blue; it may be of solid color or may have chalk stripes, silk stripe effect. This is the suit that the college man will wear to and from town and very often wear in town. Another suit that should be in the wardrobe of every well-dressed undergraduate should be either a single-breasted Glen Urquhart plaid or the newer Shepherd plaid. This suit serves many purposes. First of all it is worn on Saturdays and at athletic activities with a top coat. It may be worn when going out at night. Secondly, the coat may be worn ideally with slacks and the trousers may be worn ideally with an odd jacket. A third suit that should be in the wardrobe of the man returning to college should be a Harris tweed or a Shetland suit either in shades of brown, lovat or to please his own individuality. This suit is typical of college clothing today and may be worn, like the Shepherd check suit, with odd slacks or with odd jacket, most comfortably for outdoor activities or for football games. It is also advisable to have an extra sport jacket along. This may be of any check tweed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/fabric-guide/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Fabric Guide — Gentleman\'s Gazette">fabric</a>&nbsp;and should invariably be single-breasted with notch lapel. It may have side vents with a belted back with by-swing shoulders or the newer modified Norfolk. A pair of gray flannel Glen Urquhart plaid slacks, or the newer Shepherd plaid or tweed slacks should also be included.</p>

<p>Another necessity for the college man is the dinner coat. This may be either single or double-breasted, preferably double-breasted. This suit has many advantages. It is worn at fraternity dinners, smokers, theatre and many other evenings when a tail coat is too much and sack clothes are not enough.</p>

<p>LAST, but not least, as a matter of fact most important, is the tail coat. This will be worn at all fraternity or club dances, at proms, dancing when in town and other very formal occasions. From an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/overcoat-topcoat-jacket-guide/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Overcoat, Topcoat &amp;amp; Jacket Guide — Gentleman\'s Gazette">overcoat</a>&nbsp;standpoint the college man should have in his kit a double-breasted or single-breasted dark town coat either of oxford gray or navy blue, preferably without&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/paletot-overcoat-with-velvet-collar/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Paletot Overcoat with Velvet Collar">velvet collar</a>. This will be worn in town and will also serve as an overcoat for formal evening wear.</p>

<p>Another coat that is ideally suited for campus wear is the reversible top coat of gabardine and Harris tweed. Instead of this coat the smarter dresser may include in his wardrobe a bold checked Harris tweed Balmaccan and for bad weather days a gabardine Balmaccan. Another coat which may be used on the campus is the old time favorite, the double-breasted camel coat. The newer ones are cut much shorter. Many have leather buttons with three buttons to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-to-button-your-suits/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="How To Button Your Suits, Jackets, Vests, Overcoats, &amp; Tuxedo">button</a>&nbsp;and there is a decided flare in the skirt.</p>

<p>For football games and Winter outdoor activities it is always good taste to have either a raccoon coat or a black broadcloth coat lined with fur and a fur collar or a tweed type of coat lined with fur and a fur collar but, of course, due to the period of depression that the country has just been through, while these things are nice, they are terribly expensive and so as to substitute for these fur coats, one should by all means include in the wardrobe a double-breasted Ulster type of coat with a very heavy lining. The coat may have four or five buttons, double-breasted and a broad collar. The smarter coats of this type have no belt in the back.</p>

<p>Next in importance after having the student fitted out with his clothes are his shirts. It must be considered that students attending Universities today need shirts for every type of occasion. The shirt wardrobe should consist of country sport shirts, of town shirts which include starched collars, and of formal shirts. For general campus wear, the sport type of shirt should be as follows: It may be of flannel or flannel finished material or heavy cheviot Oxford. In model the button down collar-attached shirt and the round collar attached shirt to be worn pinned, and the medium pointed collar to be worn pinned, are the three outstanding and favorite styles. Blue is by far the best color, with gray, tan, and white following, also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-wear-yellow-menswear/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="How to Wear Yellow as a Menswear Color">yellow</a>, a new shade which has already been accepted by University men. Checked patterns, such as Glens, hound&rsquo;s tooth checks and the newer Tattersall check. Shirts for general wear and town wear should be of striped or fine checked madras, broadcloth, lighter weight Oxford. These are most popular in tab color models. The widespread tab is the newer one. It might be well to include neckband shirts in this wardrobe, and white starched collars may be worn with them. Pleated bosom shirts are again back and smart college men returning to town for the holidays will get much pleasure out of wearing pleated shirts with white starched collar and cuffs. Round collared shirts and pointed collared shirts of these medium weight materials are also correct for general and town wear. For evening wear, the plain white linen or white pique two stud open front shirt is the correct shirt with either tail coat or dinner coat. With the double-breasted dinner coat, a white turn-over starched collar may be worn and a semi-stiff pleated shirt with two studs. This shirt may also be worn with the tail coat but with the high wing collar with bold broad tabs. Single cuffs should be on all dress&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/the-shirt-guide/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="The Dress Shirt Guide — Gentleman\'s Gazette">shirts</a>.</p>

<p>The next item of apparel which depends now on both the suit and the shirt is the correct neckwear. Here again we have the sport and country and town and formal atmosphere. For general campus wear the wool cashmere&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/ties?limit=all" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Ties">tie</a>&nbsp;is still ideally suited. Smart University men have taken up the silk crocheted tie horizontal and bias stripes, and this Fall they will be more popular than they have been in many a year. Although&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/bow-ties?limit=all" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="BOW TIES">bow ties</a>&nbsp;are primarily a Spring and Summer item it would be a good idea to include a few bow ties in the wardrobe for early Fall and as they are now made of cashmere as well as silk, the student will undoubtedly get use out of them. For town wear, striped rep ties and Spitalsfield ties are back again. Foulard&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/ties?limit=all" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Ties">ties</a>&nbsp;are good for all year round, just as popular for Winter as for Summer, and every student&rsquo;s wardrobe should include these along with others. India madras&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/ties?limit=all" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Ties">ties</a>&nbsp;for early Fall are also good, new and colorful. For formal wear the newest and smartest shape is the semi-butterfly tie in both black and white and these are styles that should be sold to students going to college this Fall.</p>

<p>Undergraduates at important Universities have put their stamp of approval on wool hose and the majority of college students wear wool hose all the year round. The newest note in woolen hose is the revival of the Argyle plaids that were present a few years ago. Plaids and checks have already run the gauntlet and the new wool hose that are favored are made in 6 and 3 rib in heather and mixtures. There is also a revival of the horizontal or partridge stripe which is now considered very smart. For town wear, lisle or silk hose 6 and 3 rib in solid colors or broken check clocks. For wear with dinner clothes, black hose with white, black or colored clocks. For tail coat, sheer silk hose or fine 6 and 3 rib silk hose. The newer evening socks have a wool foot for comfort while dancing and to act as a cushion for the thin soled evening shoe.</p>

<p>ONE of the most important things to be considered in the college man&rsquo;s wardrobe is shoes which again must be suitable to the various occasions. You will notice in the forthcoming paragraph about shoes how they follow in the wake of the strictly he-man rough feeling of the tweed and how they adhere to the strict formality of dress-up clothes. For general campus wear the all-white buckskin shoe with no toe cap, red rubber heels and soles, is very important. Another shoe of the same type with black or red rubber soles is the white buck or white elk shoe with black saddlestrap. Though the brown buckskin shoe is a favorite of the horsey set they have not as yet been really accepted by college men. The brown buckskin blucher with no toe cap and heavy crepe sole and heel is a shoe that is very practical for all-campus wear and one which if liked by the student should surely be included in his wardrobe, as its smartness cannot be questioned.</p>

<p>As far as color is concerned brown is surely the favorite. Another shoe that is being worn by some of the better dressed undergraduates at smarter universities is a deep reddish brown Norwegian calf (which resembles a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/scotch-whisky101-a-beginners/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Scotch Whisky 101 - A Beginners Guide — Gentleman\'s Gazette">Scotch</a>&nbsp;grain but is not as rough) with a round toe, on the English straight last, a straight toe cap with perforations and foxing along the side of the shoe, heavy leather soles and heels. Another shoe of the same nature that is worn by many students is the deep brown calf shoe, no toe cap, with three extra large brass eyelets and crepe soles and heels. For town wear or more dressy occasions black straight tip shoe, either plain or with perforations, with a slightly rounded toe, is very smart and conservative. With dinner clothes the five hole patent leather Oxford on the long vamp. The same shoe is correct with the tail coat. Pumps are definitely in and are accepted and are also correct with tail coat. It is necessary to include in one&rsquo;s wardrobe a good pair of leather slippers with hard soles and heels. If students are fond of riding,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shoes-boots-guide/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Shoes &amp;amp; Boots Guide — Gentleman\'s Gazette">boots</a>&nbsp;either of the field type or more dressy type or the blucher riding shoe with canvas leggings should be included in the wardrobe.</p>

<p>Another very essential item of the young man&rsquo;s wardrobe is headwear. Various hats for a college term are as follows. First, the derby hat. The newer model is a rather medium height, very full crown, with a short straightish brim. The next hat that is important is the brown snap brim hat. This hat may have a binding or it may be the new semi-Homburg hat which is a new Homburg snapped down in front. One may include in one&rsquo;s wardrobe a tweed stitched hat or a one piece top cap. A small hat with rather a telescope crown and a small straightish brim resembling a Tyrolean hat is also good for campus wear. It is made of rough scratch felt.</p>

<p><img alt="Tyrolean Dobbs hat - muffler" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Tyrolean-Dobbs-hat-muffler-240x320.webp" title="Tyrolean Dobbs hat - muffler" /></p>

<p>Accessories should include various colored and white linen handkerchiefs for the every day clothes and white handkerchiefs for the formal clothes. A very smart handkerchief which should be in the wardrobe is the colored silk foulard madder handkerchief.</p>

<p>Mufflers &mdash; the silk or wool square in tied and &ndash; dyed and polka dot as well as in the old paisley patterns &mdash; are very popular.</p>

<p>The student will need a pair of white buckskin or mocha<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/leather-goods/gloves?limit=all" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Gloves">&nbsp;gloves</a>&nbsp;for dress wear. A pair of pigskin&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/leather-goods/gloves?limit=all" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Gloves">gloves</a>&nbsp;for campus wear is advisable. A pair of yellow string knit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/leather-goods/gloves?limit=all" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Gloves">gloves</a>&nbsp;for cold weather and rough country wear in general.</p>

<p>JEWELRY that is necessary is a heavy gold safety pin for one&rsquo;s collar. Gold cuff links of modest design. A wrist watch or pocket watch. If pocket watch is worn, a gold link watch chain is very good taste. Of course, the necessary collar buttons for semi-formal or dinner clothes, black, gold or semi-precious stones. For tail coat white pearl or precious stones. Also in the wardrobe should be included a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/vest-waistcoat-guide/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Vest &amp;amp; Waistcoat Guide — Gentleman\'s Gazette">waistcoat</a>. There should be white-single breasted for wear with tail coat and black single or double breasted for wear with dinner coat, although single breasted is preferable. Another waistcoat that should be suggested to students or boys going to college for the first time is a checked Tattersall waistcoat. These are very popular at smart Universities and go well with the odd jacket and slack combination.</p>

<p>Another item which would be useful to the college man is a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/the-sweater-guide/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="The Sweater Guide">sweater</a>, either the sleeveless or a regular slip-over sweater with sleeves. The newer ones are cable stitch knit and are popular in wine and blue as well as in canary and white. Shetland sweaters with a high crew neck are also very good and of course the necessary pajamas, robe, underwear, garters, and suspenders.</p>

<p>This gives you a very definite example of what to offer college men, both, from the angle of what they need and what is smart.</p>

<h2>The General Rules of Formality</h2>

<p>Every item of clothing and every accessory falls somewhere on the continuum of formality, and there are some broader principles you can use to see at a glance where that is.</p>

<p><img alt="Dress Codes Formality Scale" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/formality-scale_dress-codes-1030x436.png" /></p>

<p>Dress Codes Formality Scale</p>

<h3>1. Casual vs. Formal Colors</h3>

<p>As a rule, brighter colors are more casual than somber ones. A mid-blue&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-many-suits-does-a-man-need/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="How Many Suits Does A Gentleman Need?">suit</a>&nbsp;is less formal than one in navy&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-wear-blue-gray/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="How to Wear Blue and Gray: A Classic Menswear Color Combination">blue</a>&nbsp;or charcoal gray.</p>

<p><img alt="Colors formality scale" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/formality-scale_colors-1030x515.png" /></p>

<p>Colors formality scale</p>

<p>A useful technique to sort this out is to think of colors one could typically wear in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/loafers-explained-how-to-wear-loafer-in-spring-summer/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Loafers Explained How To Wear &amp; Style Loafer Outfits in Spring &amp; Summer with Jay Butler">summer</a>&nbsp;as casual, no matter what the season&ndash;beige, white, or light blue, for example. Although not really a bright color,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-to-wear-brown-shoes-boots-men/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="How to Wear Brown Shoes &amp; Boots">brown</a>&nbsp;is also more casual than&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-wear-blue-gray/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="How to Wear Blue and Gray">navy or grey</a>. A lot of this is owed to the long-established British distinction between city and country wear. Browns were not supposed to be worn in town, which immediately associates the color with a more casual rural setting than the charcoal grey or navy one would wear when doing business in London.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Color-and-Formality.jpg"><img alt="A navy suit is more formal than one in a brighter blue." src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Color-and-Formality-1030x1030.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>A navy suit is more formal than one in a brighter blue.</p>

<h3>2. Casual vs. Formal Texture</h3>

<p>The smoother and often the shinier the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/fabric-guide/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Fabric Guide">fabric</a>, the more formal it generally is. A textured basketweave fabric would be more likely to appear on a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/summer-sport-coat-8-secrets/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="8 Secrets Of A Great Summer Sport Coat">sports coat</a>&nbsp;than a classic suit, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/corduroy-guide/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Corduroy Guide – How To Wear It,What Cords To Buy &amp; More">corduroy</a>&nbsp;would make for casual trousers not dress&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/should-men-wear-pleated-pants/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Should Men Wear Pleated Pants?">pants</a>. As a general guideline, if there&rsquo;s strong visual evidence of the weave or texture, it&rsquo;s more casual. Ties that are made of rough wool or slubby shantung are casual while smoothly printed silks are business&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/essential-ties-every-man-should-invest-in/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="12 Essential Ties Every Man Should Invest In">ties</a>; on the other hand, you wouldn&rsquo;t wear a shiny satin silk tie to work as its shine makes it too formal for that setting; satins should be reserved for evening events. Shine can be thought of as a variant on texture, as it is usually associated with smoothness. Shiny silk appears on the lapels of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-to-button-your-suits/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="How To Button Your Suits, Jackets, Vests, Overcoats, &amp; Tuxedo">tuxedo</a>&nbsp;jackets and on cummerbunds. Velvet, which has a distinctive sheen, is used for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/dinner-jacket-black-tie-guide/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Dinner Jacket Black Tie Guide">dinner jackets</a>. Patent leather is used for opera pumps as part of formal evening wear.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/texture.jpg"><img alt="The top fabric shows a prominent weave on a casual sports coat (as does the color); the bottom shows a formal Super 150s worsted wool." src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/texture-1030x1030.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>The top fabric shows a prominent weave on a casual sports coat (as does the color); the bottom shows a formal Super 150s worsted wool.</p>

<h3>3. Patterns and Formality</h3>

<p>Similar to texture, patterns also play a role in assessing formality. Articles of clothing with patterns tend to be less formal than those that are plain. Indeed, in British tailoring, many of the most popular and classic menswear patterns, particularly&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/grids-plaids-windowpanes/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Checks, Grids, Windowpanes, and Squares in Menswear">any plaid</a>&ndash;from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/accessories/ties/houndstooth-bourette-silk-tie-navy-blue-beige-fort-belvedere" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Fort Belvedere Houndstooth Bourette Tie in Navy, Blue and Beige">houndstooth</a>&nbsp;to glen check, to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/accessories/ties/prince-wales-check-silk-tie-handmade-black-white" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Prince of Wales</a>&ndash;were originally reserved for less formal&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/country-clothes-odd-jackets-fall-1930s-c-f-peters/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Country Clothes and Odd Jackets">country wear</a>. A possible exception could be&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/accessories/ties" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Fort Belvedere Ties">ties</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/accessories/pocket-square-handkerchief" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Fort Belvedere Pocket Squares">pocket squares</a>, as all sorts of patterns are acceptable on silk business ties (the printed silk it&rsquo;s made of supersedes any informality of pattern). Even formal&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/morning-dress-guide-gallery/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Morning Dress Guide">morning wear</a>&nbsp;allows ties with patterns on them, whether geometric or stripes; however, a solid color tie would still be considered more conservative. Among patterns, those that are smaller and therefore less forceful are more formal than those that are large or loud. A mistake commonly made by beginners looking to &ldquo;dress up&rdquo; is buying designer or fashion items that usually have a lot of ornamentation, for instance, a gold and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/the-most-overrated-color-black/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="The Most Overrated Color in Menswear: Black">black</a>&nbsp;jacket, when the exact opposite&ndash;a lack of pattern&ndash;would actually be more refined.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/gucci.jpg"><img alt="A strong pattern does not make an article of clothing more formal." src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/gucci-809x1030.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>A strong pattern does not make an article of clothing more formal.</p>

<h3>4. Structure and Formality</h3>

<p>Another rule in classic menswear is that the more something is structured the more formal it is. In the realm of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-to-spot-a-quality-suit/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="How To Spot A Quality Suit">suit</a>&nbsp;jackets and sports coats, those with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/fused-half-full-canvas-suit-construction/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Glued / Fused Suit vs. Half Canvas vs. Full Canvas Construction">canvas</a>, lining, and padding have greater formality than those that are unlined or partially lined with unpadded shoulders. Ties that contain an interlining are likewise more formal than those that are hand-rolled, unlined, and untipped because the former are more constructed. Even shirts fit under this umbrella. If you have a hard collar, the shirt will be more formal than one with a soft or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/the-shirt-style-guide/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Dress Shirt Guide">unfused version</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Kingsman-1.jpg"><img alt="The tailoring in the Kingsman films displays strong structure." src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Kingsman-1.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>The tailoring of the Kingsman films displays strong structure.</p>

<h3>5. Purpose and Formality</h3>

<p>Knowing the origins and historic uses of the article of clothing, which you can learn from&nbsp;<em>The Gentleman&rsquo;s Gazette</em>, can also be a way of judging it. If you have something that was originally intended to be worn in the country, for sport, or for utilitarian purposes, like a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/flat-cap-newsboy-hat/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Flat Cap Guide">flat cap</a>&nbsp;or a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/polo-shirt-guide/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="The Polo Shirt Guide">polo shirt</a>, it would more casual than something intended as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/business-casual-men-attire/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Business Casual Men’s Attire &amp; Dress Code Explained">business attire</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Prince-Charles-in-a-flat-cap-and-country-attire-687x1030.jpg"><img alt="The flat cap has its origins in British rural clothing." src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Prince-Charles-in-a-flat-cap-and-country-attire-687x1030-687x1030.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>The flat cap has its origins in British rural clothing.</p>

<p>Now, having provided the clues that enable you to assess the formality of clothing in general, we can turn our attention to the earmarks of specific wardrobe items.</p>

<h2>Jackets</h2>

<h3>1. Structure</h3>

<p>Continuing the discussion above, when dealing with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-to-iron-suit-jacket-coat/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="How to Iron a Suit Jacket Part IV – The Complete Guide to Ironing">suit jackets</a>&nbsp;or sports coats, quite simply, more structure means a greater degree of formality. It is therefore not surprising that men who are accustomed to wearing highly structured suits every day for work turn to unstructured jackets in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/neapolitan-suits-jackets-style/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Authentic Neapolitan Suits, Jackets and Style">Neapolitan style</a>&nbsp;when they&rsquo;re not on the job precisely because they are more relaxed. This is owed to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/bespoke-tailoring-basics/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Bespoke Tailoring Basics">tailoring</a>&nbsp;of Naples, which tends toward less structure; their jackets are lightly lined and have a &ldquo;natural shoulder&rdquo; free of padding. The absence of structure has led them to be embraced by those who want to dress for fun and style rather than for business pursuits.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Natural-Shoulder-1.jpg"><img alt="Unpadded &quot;natural shoulder.&quot;" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Natural-Shoulder-1-1030x686.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>Unpadded &ldquo;natural shoulder.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>2. Fabric</h3>

<p>The broader rules about materials and patterns also apply, with coarse or patterned jackets tending toward the casual end of the spectrum contrasted with smooth, solid ones. We can easily rank the most common materials used for tailored jackets in order of casualness based on their general &ldquo;roughness&rdquo;: linen, then&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/cotton-explained/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Cotton Explained">cotton</a>, then&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/worsted-wool-suiting-guide/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Worsted Wool Suiting Guide">wool</a>&ndash;with raw or rough wools (<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/tweed-guide-harris-history-styles-patterns/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="The Curiously Compelling Story of Tweed">tweed</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/flannel-guide-fall-fabric/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Flannel">flannel</a>) being a rung below worsted, and, lastly,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/cashmere-explained/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Cashmere Explained">cashmere</a>. Wrinkling, common with linen (and cotton) can be thought of as a kind of texture, something that disrupts a smooth appearance, whereas wools do not wrinkle as easily, especially worsted, which elevates their formality. Cashmere has a smooth hand and a distinctive sheen that puts it at the high end. Pure silk could be thought of as the most formal of jacket materials, given its smoothness and shine, but these are nearly impossible to find and impractical to maintain because of the delicacy of silk fibers.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/linen.jpg"><img alt="Summer linens rank as the most casual of fabrics for their &quot;rough&quot; texture and their tendency to wrinkle easily." src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/linen-823x1030.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>Summer linens rank as the most casual of fabrics for their &ldquo;rough&rdquo; texture and their tendency to wrinkle easily.</p>

<h3>3. Pockets</h3>

<p>Unique among menswear items,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/pockets-complete-guide/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Pockets in Menswear: The Complete Guide">pocket style</a>&nbsp;on a jacket serves as a strong indicator of how casual or formal it is.</p>

<p><img alt="Jacket pockets formality scale" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/formality-scale_jacket-pockets-1030x515.png" /></p>

<p>Jacket pockets formality scale</p>

<p>Patch pockets, which are formed from material sewn onto the surface of the jacket&rsquo;s lower front quarters, are the most casual; they are common on sports coats and casual&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-to-button-your-suits/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="How To Button Your Suits, Jackets, Vests, Overcoats, &amp; Tuxedo">suits</a>. If there is a patch breast pocket as well, the jacket becomes even more relaxed. Next up in formality are flap pockets. Usually, with flap pockets,&nbsp;no additional material is used on the surface of the jacket; the pockets are hidden beneath the surface of the jacket with only the flap visible. Flap pockets were originally associated with country wear in British tailoring&nbsp;but are now most common on business suits, though they may also feature in sports coats. Lastly, we have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/jetted-pockets/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Jetted vs. Flap Pockets">jetted pockets</a>, which are like flap pockets in construction but with no flap; the pocket is simply a slit with edge stitching. The result is a very clean, minimalist look, which you&rsquo;ll find on formal wear:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/dinner-jacket-black-tie-guide/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Dinner Jacket Black Tie Guide">dinner jackets</a>, tuxedos and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/morning-dress-dress-code/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Morning Dress: Dress Code">morning wear</a>.</p>

<p><img alt="Patch Pocket, Green &amp; Orange" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Patch-Pocket-Green-Orange-601x900.webp" /></p>

<p>Patch pockets are more casual</p>

<h3>4. Lapels</h3>

<p>Lastly, lapels are an easy way to assess a jacket&rsquo;s formality.</p>

<p>Jacket lapels formality scale</p>

<p>In a nutshell, a notched lapel is less formal than a peak lapel, which is the most formal kind, appearing on power suits and formal wear. On a tuxedo or dinner jacket, you may also see a shawl collar; this is limited to formal jackets, so it remains more elevated than a notch lapel but is still more relaxed than a peak lapel. Thus, for example, a white dinner jacket that would be worn on a summer&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/cruise-ship-primer/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Cruise Ship Primer">cruise</a>&nbsp;should technically have a shawl collar given the relatively relaxed nature of the garment compared to a black tuxedo.</p>

<h2>Pants</h2>

<p>As a visual cue to assess formality, if a pair of pants has a sharp crease down the center of the legs, it&rsquo;s more formal than one with a smooth front. The former are &ldquo;dress pants,&rdquo; while the latter would also include chinos and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/denim-jeans-guide/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="The Denim Jeans Guide">jeans</a>. The &ldquo;crease&rdquo; division not coincidentally conforms to the rule of materials as well because dress pants are mostly made of wool while&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/khaki-pants-chinos-trousers/%22" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Khakis and Chinos">chinos</a>&nbsp;are made from cotton or linen. Frankly, wool holds a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-iron-dress-pants-trousers/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="How to Iron Dress Pants">crease</a>&nbsp;much better than cotton or linen.</p>

<p>Within the category of chinos itself, there can be a range of formality as well: more casual chinos display a visible flat seam on the inner legs whereas so-called &ldquo;dress chinos&rdquo; are cleaner, with seams that are minimized. The presence of ornamental details on pockets, like metal rivets or decorative stitching, such as what you&rsquo;d see on a pair of jeans, are also emblems of casual style.</p>

<h2>Shirts</h2>

<h3>1. Fabric</h3>

<p>What looks at first glance like the same plain white dress shirt can offer varying levels of formality depending on factors like the weave, the cuffs, and the collar. With its relative thickness, somewhat rough texture, and patch pocket, the Oxford cloth typical of the classic&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/oxford-cloth-button-down-shirt-ocbd/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="The Oxford Cloth Button-Down Shirt">OCBD</a>&nbsp;shirt is considered among the more casual dress shirting fabrics. For this reason, they add a casual touch to tailoring and may be more associated with sports coats than business suits, though the rule is flexible. Common pinpoint cotton or broadcloth represent a middle ground in business shirts: they can be worn with essentially anything as well but are more formal than OCBDs. Even more elevated are weaves that continue the association of&nbsp;shininess and formality, like Royal Oxford and twills; these are best worn with suits or formal wear. Of course, following the established general principles, patterned shirts are more casual than solids, and the bigger or more visible the pattern (think wide butcher stripes or plaids) the more casual the shirt will be.</p>

<p><img alt="Paul Newman wears a classic oxford collar button down OCBD" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Paul-Newman-in-a-classic-white-button-down-606x900.jpg" /></p>

<h3>2. Collars</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/the-shirt-style-guide/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Men\'s Dress Shirt Style Guide">Dress shirt</a>&nbsp;collars come in a variety of forms, and, once more, the button-down collar is the most casual, perhaps because of its association with the OCBD, or with the sport of polo, or because it shows visible buttons.</p>

<p><img alt="Collars formality scale" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/formality-scale_collars-1030x274.png" /></p>

<p>Collars formality scale</p>

<p>After this, the point, semi-spread, and spread are about equal in terms of formality, and all are appropriate for business settings. They can&rsquo;t really be ordered in terms of formality, though arguably, because variants of the spread collar are&nbsp;<em>de rigueur</em>&nbsp;with tuxedos, it may be somewhat more elevated. Collars with vintage appeal, such as a tab collar, hearken back to a more formal time and are consequently seen as more formal especially when worn with a tie pin. The wing collar may be the most formal of all, as it is only worn with formal wear and has associations with vintage style.</p>

<h3>3. Cuffs</h3>

<p>This is an easy one since, unlike collars, there are only a few kinds of shirt cuffs. Basically, French or double cuffs that require cufflinks are more elevated than ones with buttons. With a tux or a morning suit, only French cuffs will do; on the other hand, wearing French cuffs with a casual linen sports coat would look out of place.</p>

<p><img alt="Double Cuffs &amp; precious cuff links" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Double-Cuffs-precious-cuff-links-600x900.webp" /></p>

<p>French cuffs paired with semi-precious stone cufflinks heightens the formality of an ensemble</p>

<h2>Ties</h2>

<p>Where wool reigns supreme as the formal fabric for tailored jackets and dress pants, silk is the queen of tie fabrics. However, not all silks are equally formal. Ties made of raw (<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/catalogsearch/result/?q=shantung" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Fort Belvedere shantung ties">shantung</a>) or wild (tussah) silk that shows a lot of texture or slubbiness and those that are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/accessories/ties/knit-ties" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Fort Belvedere knit ties">knitted</a>&nbsp;(as opposed to woven) silk are perfect to wear with casual tailoring. An interesting exception is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/catalogsearch/result/?q=grenadine">grenadine</a>, which is a popular choice for business wear even though the weave is quite an obvious feature. Perhaps this is owed to its shininess. Ties made of materials other than silk, such as linen, cotton, wool, and even cashmere, remain less formal, either because they are not as smooth or shiny. Interestingly, pattern matters less with ties in determining formality&ndash;a printed silk tie with stripes or a repeating geometric pattern is only barely less formal than one in a solid color.</p>

<h2>Shoes</h2>

<p><img alt="Shoes Formality Scale" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/formality-scale_shoes-1-1030x187.png" /></p>

<p>Shoes Formality Scale</p>

<p>In order from least formal to most formal&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/five-dress-shoes-you-need/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="The First 5 Dress Shoes You Need to Start a Shoe Collection">dress shoes</a>&nbsp;(excluding&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-to-wear-boots-102/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="How To Wear Boots 102 – Beyond The Basic Boot Styles">boots</a>), we have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/loafer-guide-penny-gucci-tassels-weejuns/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Loafer Guide">loafers</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/derby-shoe-blucher-guide/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Derby Shoe and Blucher Guide">derbies</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/monk-strap-shoes-guide/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Monk Strap Shoes Guide">monk straps</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/oxford-shoes-guide/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Oxford Shoes Guide">oxfords</a>. The very name &ldquo;loafer&rdquo; implies casual relaxation as does its slipper-like form. Derby shoes were originally country wear though they are at home with sport coats and even suits these days; still their association with casual settings remains. Monk straps are sort of at the same formality levels as derbies, but they are perhaps more frequently worn with suits than a derby would be. Lastly, we have oxfords, which are the most formal of shoes, equally useful for suits and formal wear. Color also matters, with black shoes considered more elevated than brown, again based on the old British &ldquo;no brown in town&rdquo; rule. Indeed, even now many men will only wear black shoes with navy or gray business suits though brown is worn for everything in Italy and has become more acceptable with suits in most settings. The principles of shine and texture also apply, with suede and nubuck shoes being more laid back than polished calf leather.</p>

<p><img alt="Country gents in riding attire fashion illustration" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Country-gents-in-riding-attire-fashion-illustration-954x1030.jpg" /></p>

<p>Note the bold patterns, brighter colors, and warm brown tones indicate less formal attire; these split-tow Norwegians are traditionally country wear</p>

<p>Beyond these principles, two factors&ndash;ornamentation and structure&ndash;are also influential when determining the formality of shoes.</p>

<h3>1. Ornamentation</h3>

<p>With shoes, less is more (formal, that is), in terms of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/brogues-shoe-guide-men/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Brogues Shoes Guide">broguing</a>&nbsp;and other ornamental details like wingtips. Case in point: the black&nbsp;patent oxfords worn with evening attire are actually quite plain except for their high shine, and for everyday business wear, black oxfords with a plain captoe are appropriate. In fact, these black oxfords are also the shoe to wear with a formal morning suit. However, those who are new to classic style may be drawn to the intricate perforations that form the broguing on a shoe. They assume because broguing is so ornate and requires extra leather work that more of it equals a fancier shoe. On the contrary, simple is more elegant, something we can remember when we keep in mind that brogue perforations were originally designed for drainage on country shoes.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/derby-and-oxford.jpg"><img alt="A cognac wingtip derby shoe with broguing versus a simple black captoe oxford, both from Acemarks" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/derby-and-oxford-1030x1030.jpg" /></a></p>

<h3>2. Structure</h3>

<p>Although all loafers can be called&nbsp;<em>mocassini&nbsp;</em>in Italian, even these can be sub-divided in terms of how much structure they have. A soft loafer is generally made of suede and is quite slipper-like, looking more like what one would consider a true moccasin. It&rsquo;s an excellent shoe for summer weather as it is very lightweight and comfortable, which also makes it casual. Structured loafers can come in either suede or calf leather but are firmer and by virtue of this, more formal in appearance.</p>

It is an entertaining murder mystery&nbsp;with an excellent cast, which is&nbsp;a study of the British class system in the 1930&rsquo;s with all its intricacies, problems and infidelities. As you have likely&nbsp;guessed, we will focus on the 1930&rsquo;s period clothing worn by the male actors.</p>

<h2>The Story</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/godford-park.webp" rel="prettyPhoto"><img alt="Gosford Park" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/godford-park-300x168.webp" style="height:168px; width:300px" title="Gosford Park" /></a></p>

<p>Gosford Park</p>

<p>The plot of this movie was written by Julian Fellowes, who is an expert in 19<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;and 20th-century country house society in England. He is also the mastermind behind the story of the hugely popular TV series,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/downton-abbey-huntsman/" title="Downton Abbey &amp; Huntsman">Downton Abbey</a>.</p>

<p>Interestingly, in the opening scene, we can spot a yellow Rolls Royce just like in&nbsp;of our last movie! It belongs to&nbsp;<em>Lady Trentham,</em>&nbsp;a snobbish, and often sarcastic member of the British upper class. She is fabulously personified by Maggie Smith, a Downton Abbey alumni, who acts with superb wit and utterly personifies the derision of her class. Of course, her newly hired Scottish maid,&nbsp;<em>Mary Maceachran</em>&nbsp;(Kelly MacDonald, also</p>

It was a very characteristic scene of the movie and the upper-class system in Britain at the time &ndash; everything evolved around the few masters.</p>

<p>The mansion, as well as its guests, are filled with expectations, jealousy, lust, and fear. For the most part, Mary indirectly guides us through these intricacies of the system by observing and questioning the people she meets.</p>

<h3>The Gosford Park Characters</h3>

<p><img alt="Gosford Park Sir William McCordle in Plaid Tweed Country Suit" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/gosford-park-sir-william-mccordle-in-plaid-tweed-c-400x224.webp" title="Gosford Park Sir William McCordle in Plaid Tweed Country Suit" /></p>

<p>Gosford Park is set on an English countryside estate during a shooting weekend in November 1932. It is hosted by&nbsp;<em>Sir William McCordle,</em>&nbsp;(Michael Gambon) a prosperous factory owner and his wife, Lady Sylvia, (Kristin Scott Thomas). He seems to be a rather strange fellow who is interested only in guns and&nbsp;his dog, but foremost in his affairs with all kinds of women, including almost the entire household staff. Lady Sylvia, on the other hand, has sensed these infidelities, and she always seems&nbsp;open to an affair herself whenever the opportunity arises.</p>

<p>The guests include&nbsp;<em>Lady Trentham</em>, some upper class snobs, as well as a socially isolated and suffering bourgeoise redhead without a maid and just one evening gown in &ldquo;green&rdquo;. &ldquo;Such a difficult colour&rdquo; Lady Trentham remarks sharply and disrespectfully.</p>

<p><img alt="Stroller Suit" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/stroller-suit-400x224.webp" title="Stroller Suit" /></p>

<p>Moreover, the Hollywood actor and vocal entertainer,&nbsp;<em>Ivor Novello,</em>&nbsp;(Jeremy Northam) as well as his &ldquo;funny little American&rdquo; producer friend (Bob Balaban) are among the guests.</p>

<p>Within the mix of emotions and personal desires, there are many motives for murder, and just after the affair of Sir William with house maid Elsie (played by Emily Watson) is revealed at the dinner table, he is discovered stabbed in the library.</p>

<p>While the amateurish inspector (personified by pipe-smoking Stephen Fry) disregards even the most obvious clues revealed by his constable, hardly anyone shows any signs of sincere grief. When Lady</p>

<p>Sylvia is asked whether she wants &ldquo;some company&rdquo; just after her husband was stabbed, she sighs &ldquo;I suppose life must go on,&rdquo; while her companion removes her dress. In the following scenes, quite a few people in the house fear their secrets may be revealed, while others show their relief over Sir William&rsquo;s death for various reasons.</p>

<p>Throughout the plot, both upstairs and downstairs, the nature of the characters are revealed slowly, but never entirely exhibited, and consequently we learn something new in every scene until the very end.</p>

<h2>Gosford Park Locations</h2>

<p><img alt="Patch Chest Pocket" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/patch-chest-pocket-400x224.webp" title="Patch Chest Pocket" /></p>

<p>Although it seems that all the filming took place in one house as well as its surroundings, the movie was in fact filmed in multiple locations. Apparently, the staircase, dining room, drawing room and some exterior scenes were filmed at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.wrothampark.com/"><em>Wrotham Park</em></a>. The scenes in the upstairs bedrooms were shot at&nbsp;<em>Syon House,</em>&nbsp;and the movie&rsquo;s opening sequence, as well as the hunt was taken at&nbsp;<em>Hall Barn</em>. The downstairs area, on the other hand, was filmed on a set, and for various other locations the crew went to&nbsp;<em>Shepperton Studios</em>.</p>

<h2>Gosford Park &amp; the Clothes</h2>

<p>Set in the 30&rsquo;s and blessed with a huge cast, Gosford Park has quite a few beautiful clothes and accessories to enjoy. Let&rsquo;s look a little more closely at the male attire:</p>

I particularly liked the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/norfolk-jacket-guide/" title="The Norfolk Jacket Guide – History, Style &amp; How to Buy">Norfolk shooting outfits</a>&nbsp;we can see when they are out and about. If you observe the pictures closely, you will notice all kinds of details apart from the beautiful cloth colors. There are lots of interesting pleats, plus fours, colored shooting<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/socks?limit=all" title="Socks">&nbsp;socks</a>, and most importantly, high armholes. When shooting you really want small armholes so you can move comfortably.</p>

<p>Take a look at the gentleman in his three piece brown and beige shepherd&rsquo;s check tweed suit. I think it suits him very well. It is worn with</p>

<p><img alt="Gosford Park Shooting Tweed Suit" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/gosford-park-shooting-tweed-suit-400x224.webp" title="Gosford Park Shooting Tweed Suit" /></p>

<p>a tweed cap, a checked&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/the-shirt-guide/" title="The Dress Shirt Guide — Gentleman&amp;#039;s Gazette">shirt</a>&nbsp;with a flimsy collar, and a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/ties?limit=all" title="Ties">tie</a>. Note that&nbsp;he wears his&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/waiscoat-button/" title="The Unfastened Waiscoat Button">bottom waistcoat button undone</a>.</p>

<p>Or look at this wonderful color combination of a reddish brown tweed suit with a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/lovat-green-summer-jacket/" title="Lovat Green Summer Jacket – Apparel Arts 1933">lovat green</a>&nbsp;knit vest, matching&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/ties?limit=all" title="Ties">tie</a>, and soft (slightly too large) turndown collar. I particularly like the patch chest pocket with an inverted pleat. Something like this is only to be found in bespoke garments nowadays. Surprisingly, his coat features 4 sleeve buttons instead of the usual &ndash;&nbsp;more informal &ndash;&nbsp;two buttons (sometimes even one or none) for country wear.</p>

<p><img alt="Gosford Park Striped Suit Short Peaked Lapels" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/gosford-park-striped-suit-short-peaked-lapels-400x224.webp" title="Gosford Park Striped Suit Short Peaked Lapels" /></p>

<p>Sir William wears a nice Norfolk Outfit for shooting. The lapels are very small and slim, and we find the typical decoration on the front and back as well as a permanently attached belt. He combined it with a tattersall check shirt, plaid tie and brownish-yellow&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/corduroy-guide/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Corduroy Guide – How To Wear It,What Cords To Buy &amp; More">corduroy</a>&nbsp;vest with grey piping! Just like the other chap, he wears his&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/waiscoat-button/" title="The Unfastened Waiscoat Button">bottom waistcoat button unfastened</a>. Instead of wearing a tweed cap, he opted for a soft, mid brown felt hat.</p>

<h3>The Americans</h3>

<p><img alt="Paisley Dressing Gown" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/paisley-dressing-gown-400x224.webp" title="Paisley Dressing Gown" /></p>

<p>The Americans do not wear the typical tweed suits, but rather heavy worsted&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/fabric-guide/" title="Fabric Guide — Gentleman&amp;#039;s Gazette">fabrics</a>. The American producer is seen in a&nbsp;single breasted, black and beige houndstooth suit with a red overplaid, light shirt and orange-red ascot. When in his room, we see him wearing his paisley&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/dressing-gown/" title="Robes &amp; Dressing Gowns">dressing gown</a>. His valet is mostly seen in a classic&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/stresemann/" title="The Stresemann – a German variety of the Stroller">stroller suit</a>&nbsp;with black bowler.</p>

<p>Ivor Novello, on the other hand, wears a shadow striped, single breasted three piece suit with elegant peaked lapels. Typical for the thirties, the lapels are rather short and wide, providing with a distinctive vintage look. He wears this suit with a striped shirt and a patterned tie.</p>

<h3>Gosford Park Clothes Maintenance</h3>

<p>Interestingly, we can also see the maids and valets working on their masters&rsquo; clothes on several occasions in the movie. In one scene, we see how a valet is ironing. In the other, we see the butler inspecting the detachable collars for flaws, and in another, how they polish shoes.</p>

<h3>Livery</h3>

<p>The livery is also rather well done. The footmen, valets and the butler wear morning coats with striped trousers during the day, and in the evening, we see beautiful black tailcoats, with a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/paletot-overcoat-with-velvet-collar/" title="Paletot Overcoat with Velvet Collar">velvet collar</a>, silver buttons, and a diagonally mid-grey and charcoal striped&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/vest-waistcoat-guide/" title="Vest &amp;amp; Waistcoat Guide — Gentleman&amp;#039;s Gazette">waistcoat</a>&nbsp;which is buttoned rather high and features silver buttons as well.</p>

<h3>Gosford Park White Tie Evening Attire</h3>

<p><img alt="Gosford Park White Tie &amp; Piano" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/gosford-park-white-tie-piano-400x224.webp" title="Gosford Park White Tie &amp; Piano" /></p>

<p>In the evening, the ladies wear their evening gowns and jewels, while the gentlemen dress in their proper white<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/ties?limit=all" title="Ties">&nbsp;tie</a>&nbsp;outfits. Everyone of them wears a stiff fronted shirt with a stiff, detachable wing collar and studs. The white Marcella cotton vests are all single breasted, though some have a shawl collar lapel, whereas others went with the pointed ones. Also, the taller men have 4 waistcoat&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-to-button-your-suits/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="How To Button Your Suits, Jackets, Vests, Overcoats, &amp; Tuxedo">buttons</a>, whereas shorter men only have 3. Note: when the gentlemen sit down for dinner, the shirt front curves up heavily.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p><img alt="Gosford Park White Tie - stiff shirt front" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/gosford-park-white-tie-stiff-shirt-front-400x224.webp" title="Gosford Park White Tie - stiff shirt front" /></p>

<p>Altogether, I can highly recommend&nbsp;<em>Gosford Park</em>&nbsp;because of its compelling story and&nbsp;its sharp analysis of the English class system at the time, as well as the clothes, jewelry and simply the whole English Country lifestyle. Imagine how you would dress for such a weekend!</p>

Still, buying vintage isn&rsquo;t always a breeze.</p>

<h2>Benefits Of Vintage Clothing</h2>

<p><img alt="Vintage Clothing" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Vintage-Clothing-601x900.jpg" /></p>

<p>Vintage Clothing</p>

<h3>1. You May Find Garments That Are Not Commonly Produced Any More.</h3>

<p>If you do find garments like these, they&rsquo;ll allow you to stand out even from other&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-to-dress-up/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">well-dressed</a>&nbsp;men; you can be a true&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/my-life-with-a-dandy/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">dandy</a>&nbsp;in head-to-toe vintage if that&rsquo;s your thing, or you can mix vintage and contemporary pieces for a look that&rsquo;s still classic and harmonious. Whatever the case may be, having a few vintage pieces in your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wardrobe-maintenance-essentials/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">wardrobe</a>&nbsp;will allow you to be truly unique and inventive with your outfits.</p>

<h3>2. Prices Are Often A Fraction Of What You Would Pay For Something New.</h3>

<p>Our founder, Sven Raphael Schneider has had good luck purchasing things at European flea markets especially in the off seasons. For example, he once found an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-to-buy-an-overcoat/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">overcoat</a>&nbsp;in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/summer-suits-cool-hot/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">summer</a>&nbsp;that no one else was looking at because it was out of season and got it for a real bargain.</p>

<h3>3. Vintage Garments Can Generally Be Tailored Just As Easily As Something New.</h3>

<p>This depends on the individual garment, of course, and whether it&rsquo;s got excess fabric to let out or remove. As an example, you could find a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/summer-sport-coat-8-secrets/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">sport coat</a>&nbsp;for $15- 20 dollars, spend another $30 or so on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/bespoke-tailoring-basics/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">tailoring</a>&nbsp;and end up with a vintage piece that fits you like a glove for just a fraction of the price of what you would have paid for a new garment and that&rsquo;s one that probably wouldn&rsquo;t fit you as well right off the rack anyway.</p>

<h3>4. Vintage Garments Are Often More Durable.</h3>

<p>In a similar vein, older methods of clothing construction were often more durable both in terms of the raw materials used and in the detail of human construction. Conversely, a lot of modern clothing made for the fast fashion world that we live in is frankly designed to fall apart in the days when durability was prized over having the newest and latest garments of the season. You could get a great deal more wear out of your pieces.</p>

<h3>5. You Will Be Supporting Your Local Economy.</h3>

<p>Another plus by shopping at a consignment store or similar establishment, you&rsquo;ll be supporting your local economy rather than some giant corporation; this isn&rsquo;t to say that we&rsquo;re suggesting you swear off Macy&rsquo;s, of course, but it is nice to know that in some circumstances, you&rsquo;re supporting small businesses in your area.</p>

<h3>6. Buying Vintage Is A Greener Way To Shop.</h3>

<p>In a similarly conscious frame of mind, buying vintage garments is a particularly green way to shop since you&rsquo;re essentially recycling old garments and giving them a new lease on life. Furthermore, because you&rsquo;re not buying a new garment and therefore contributing to that supply chain, you are theoretically reducing the amount of raw materials needed to produce more similar new garments.</p>

<h3>7. You Might Not Have To Buy At All.</h3>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve got older relatives who are looking to downsize their wardrobes, family heirlooms like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/affordable-vintage-watches/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">watches</a>, for example, or friends who just know that you&rsquo;re on the lookout for vintage items, you might be able to come up with some vintage finds at no cost to you.</p>

<h3>8. Vintage Pieces Make For A Great Conversation Starter.</h3>

<p>Finally in the positives category, buying and wearing vintage provides a great&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-to-get-to-know-someone/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">conversation starter</a>&nbsp;for those who might be especially curious about what you&rsquo;re wearing.

Now most of the coverage about Sean has evolved around his clothes, especially his&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/ties?limit=all" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Ties">ties</a>, but there is more to his story. While he has truly amassed a treasure of vintage clothes over the last decades, their Brooklyn apartment is fascinating tribute to their tastes &ndash; it is an expression of Sean &amp; Meredith&rsquo;s passion and lifestyle. Both of them have decorated their home together and it seams unfair just to mention him, especially because she has sacrificed a lot of closet / storage space for his collection.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Meredith-Modzelewski-Sean-Crowley.webp"><img alt="Meredith Modzelewski &amp; Sean Crowley" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Meredith-Modzelewski-Sean-Crowley-600x400.webp" style="height:400px; width:600px" /></a></p>

<p>Meredith Modzelewski &amp; Sean Crowley</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When I met the two on a lovely Sunday afternoon, they kindly invited me up into their apartment and showed me their entire home. As someone who is prone to observe details, I felt like my senses were overstimulated. On the right, there was a wall full of magazines, miniature figures and vintage hats including college caps, a safari hat and a grey bowler hat &ndash; when have you seen that combination for the last time? To my left, I glimpsed at an umbrella stand full of antique canes and silk&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/umbrella-guide/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">umbrellas</a>. &nbsp;Later, in conversation it turned out that Sean had located an old chap who restored these old umbrellas &ndash; something I would have never thought existed in New York City. Straight ahead of me I could see a living room with a vintage rug, about a hundred liquor bottles which Sean acquired all over the place, including the internet.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Caps-Safari-Hat-Grey-Bowler-Hat.webp"><img alt="Caps, Safari Hat &amp; Grey Bowler Hat" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Caps-Safari-Hat-Grey-Bowler-Hat-400x600.webp" style="height:600px; width:400px" /></a></p>

<p>Caps, Safari Hat &amp; Grey Bowler Hat</p>

<p>As you can see in the pictures, their place is decorated with every kind of tidbit you can imagine: paintings, drawing, photographs, candle holders, boxes, figures, trays, hats&hellip; and while it would be too much for my personal taste, I admire their persistence to create their very own style based on vintage goods, militaria and memorabilia. Sean &amp; Meredith truly are collectors that surround themselves by the things they love and I am sure if New York rent prices wouldn&rsquo;t be as high, they could easily decorate a place four times the size with the treasures they have. Since it was such a lovely day, the two suggested we have a little picnic in the adjacent park, and so Sean grabbed two of his numerous blankets, Meredith brought along the tray and we had some delicious seed cake that Sean had baked earlier that day, which went perfectly with some tea and I particularly enjoyed the port wine afterwards.</p>

<h2>How it all started</h2>

<p>While outside, I had a chance to ask all sorts of questions and of course I was interested in how their interest in vintage items evolved and how it tied in with their careers. From an early age on, Sean was always good for a joke and quickly became the class clown. Inspired by vintage movies from the US and especially Britain, he developed an interest in clothes, one day he even wore his grandfather&rsquo;s morning coat to school. Subsequently, he decided to pursue a career in the movie world, and after college he moved to LA. After a short while, he realized that this city and lifestyle was not for him and when he stumbled upon Apparel Arts magazines with drawings from the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/laurence-fellows-fashion-illustrator/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Laurence Fellows - An Iconic Fashion Illustrator — Gentleman\'s Gazette">Laurence Fellows</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/leslie-saalburg-fashion-illustrator-extraordinaire/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Leslie Saalburg Esquire Apparel Arts Fashion Illustrator — Gentleman\'s Gazette">Leslie Saalburg</a>&nbsp;he knew he had to move back to the east coast. Once returned, he would visit flea markets to hunt for old treasures and so he met&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/bobby-from-boston-vintage-clothes-for-men/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Bobby From Boston – Vintage Clothes For Men">Bobby from Boston,</a>&nbsp;whom he would partner and travel together to England to buy vintage clothes and items as you know them from Ralph Lauren stores and from his apartment.</p>

<p>One day, his friend Derek Miller , who used to work for Ralph Lauren but now runs Barker Black, suggested that he should try to join the RL family as a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/ties?limit=all" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Ties">tie</a>&nbsp;designer. Without any formal design training in the clothing trade, he applied for a position at Ralph Lauren but because of his lack of experience, he was declined. While some would have been discouraged by such developments, Sean learned how to actually design&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/ties?limit=all" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Ties">ties</a>&nbsp;and what goes into it, landing him a job with Lauren. Over the years, he has been designing for the Rugby line as well as the RRL line, which focuses on clothes with a heavily vintage inspired style.</p>

<p>College memorabilia</p>

<p>Meredith is also infatuated with vintage items and she supports Sean in his collecting efforts even though it means that her closet space is shrinking at the same time. If it wasn&rsquo;t for her slim waist and curvy hips, she would wear much more vintage clothing but as it stands it is just difficult for her to find something that truly fits. In her day job, she works as a freelance writer and social media expert but on the weekends she can visit flea markets and live the vintage inspired life they want.</p>

<h2>The clothes of Sean Crowley</h2>

<p>Sean is most well known for his extensive&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/ties?limit=all" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Ties">tie</a>&nbsp;collection which consists upward of 3,000&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/ties?limit=all" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Ties">ties</a>, though that is just an estimate. His gigantic tie rack has been featured on various occasions and you have to bear in mind&nbsp; that every row has ties stacked on top of each other. Overall, it is a very colorful selection. In the top row, you can see his&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/bow-ties?limit=all" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="BOW TIES">bow tie</a>&nbsp;collection, which includes&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/single-end-bowtie/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="The Single-End Bow Tie">butterfly and batswing bow ties</a>, as well as pointed and a few unusual shapes.</p>

<p>Next up, you can find micropattern ties and 1930&rsquo;s inspired designs. Some of them are true vintage while others are RL replicas. Striped club and repp ties seem to be the largest part of his collection, though he seems to have a little bit of everything,&nbsp; including plaid ties, wool, linen or blended ties as well as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/ties/knit-ties?limit=36" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">knit ties</a>. Overall, he could wear a different tie every day for more than 8 years but there is more to his collection than just ties.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Vintage-Uniforms.webp"><img alt="Vintage Uniforms" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Vintage-Uniforms-400x600.webp" style="height:600px; width:400px" /></a></p>

<p>Vintage Uniforms</p>

<p>Three piece tweed suits are part of his collection just as well as uniforms, a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.morningdressguide.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Ultimate Morning Dress Guide for Morning Suit, Coat, Stroller Suit &amp;amp; Formal Day Wear">morning coat</a>&nbsp;and tailcoat. Fortunately, he doesn&rsquo;t just use them as show pieces, but he also wears them whenever he gets a chance. Of course, the uniforms are usually worn at parties only and I think that is fantastic. One of the hats he was particularly proud of is his grey top hat &ndash; it had signatures all over the lining dating from parties in the 1910&rsquo;s &ndash; 1930&rsquo;s &ndash; how cool is that?!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Grey-top-hat-with-signatures.webp"><img alt="Grey top hat with signatures" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Grey-top-hat-with-signatures-600x400.webp" style="height:400px; width:600px" /></a></p>

<p>Grey top hat with signatures</p>

<p>Apart from that, I asked to take a look at his odd waistcoats, and sure enough he had everything from doeskin, hunting vest, tattersall, herringbone, dove grey morning waistcoats etc. All of them were vintage but it is easy to see where the inspiration for many Ralph Lauren products comes from.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Odd-wasitcoats.webp"><img alt="Odd waistcoats" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Odd-wasitcoats-600x400.webp" style="height:400px; width:600px" /></a></p>

<p>Odd waistcoats</p>

<p>When I asked Sean about his thoughts on clothing etiquette and rules he made a point that he is not really interested in dressing 100% the way people did in the 1930&rsquo;s, which is why they have never joined organizations such as the Art D&eacute;co society. He just happens to like the manifold options in vintage clothing and he just wears it rather than trying to match everything. &nbsp;So, he happily wears his the barathea silk faced&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/black-tie-tuxedo-guide/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Black Tie &amp; Tuxedo Pocket Guide">tuxedo</a>&nbsp;lapel with his satin silk&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/bow-ties?limit=all" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="BOW TIES">bow tie</a>&nbsp;and doesn&rsquo;t care if the marcella patterns in his white<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/ties?limit=all" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Ties">&nbsp;tie</a>&nbsp;ensemble don&rsquo;t match &ndash; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s pedantic&rdquo; he says. Personally, I like details and I also think that the v-neck of a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/tennis-sweater-cricket-cable-stitch/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="The Cable Knit Tennis Sweater – Cricket Jumper">tennis sweater</a>&nbsp;looks better with a tie but most importantly it is about the wearer and how he presents himself, and Sean is a true character who enjoys wearing what he likes, and I very much appreciate that.</p>

<p>When I ask him about other accessories, he pulls out a drawer with all kind of suede and peccary&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/leather-goods/gloves?limit=all" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Gloves">gloves</a>&nbsp;in shades of brown, grey and chamois but not black (black&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/leather-goods/gloves?limit=all" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Gloves">gloves&nbsp;</a>only became popular in modern times). Also, I can find some old<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/pocket-square-handkerchief?limit=all" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Pocket Squares">&nbsp;pocket squares&nbsp;</a>with exquisitely fine hand-rolled edges &ndash; the quality of these hanks is nowhere to be found anymore. His cufflink box was rather small compared to his tie collection but it and if featured many silk knots but also beautiful chain links. Of course, he also had a wide range of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/collarpin/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Collar Pin Guide">collar pins</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.morningdressguide.com/morningwear-accessories/tie-stick-pins/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Tie Stick Pins — Morning Dress Guide">tie stick pins&nbsp;</a>and pocket watches.</p>

<h2>Vintage home decoration</h2>

<p>Meredith and Sean have decorated everything in their home &ndash; even the kitchen and the bathroom. When you look around their apartment you find numerous little things such as knife rests, tea warmers or various kinds of silver- and glassware. Of course, when you buy vintage, you can often find true quality products for a bargain, though often times you end up with mismatched sets because you simply can&rsquo;t buy a certain glass, spoon or plate anymore. In my opinion, it looks nicer if you have sets on a table that match or at least harmonize together but Sean and Meredith just decided to not care about matching at all and so their style is to almost intentionally mismatch every set. So the tea cup and saucer don&rsquo;t match the plate and my spoon was different than theirs. While I probably wouldn&rsquo;t do that, they created their very own style, which works perfectly for them. On the way back from the park, Sean says something along the lines of &ldquo;money, can&rsquo;t you buy you taste &ndash; there are so many great vintage pieces around even today but just because you have loads of money you won&rsquo;t find them&rdquo; &ndash; very true.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Tray.webp"><img alt="A not so simple tray" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Tray-600x400.webp" style="height:400px; width:600px" /></a></p>

Emily Chalmers and Ali Hanan explain how to find fresh and unexpected uses of second-hand pieces and antiques, and reveal how to mix old and new with flair and panache. The first part of the book, Flea Market Finds, looks at household goods, from fabrics and furniture to china, kitchenware, glass and lighting, and describes how to find special objects and identify them on the basis of their quality, character, resilience, color, and texture. The authors advocate a subtle mixing of styles, patterns, and colors, and emphasize the beauty of objects that have seen a bit of life. They explain how to locate bargain copies of modern classics&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;or the real things&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;and how to mix flea-market or thrift-store finds with high-end basics.</p>

<p><em>The Find</em></p>

<h2><em>The Find</em></h2>

<p>Sometimes you&rsquo;re looking for it, sometimes it just finds you.</p>

<p>Treasures of home d&eacute;cor abound at flea markets, thrift shops, and garage sales. But how do you know a find when you find it?</p>

<p>In&nbsp;<em>The Find</em>, Stan Williams and some of today&rsquo;s most clever style makers, including Simon Doonan, John Derian, and Real Simple&rsquo;s Kristin van Ogtrop&nbsp;<em>&mdash;&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;all diehard devotees of New York City&rsquo;s Housing Works &mdash;&nbsp;show not just what to look for, but also how to look at an object to identify a great piece. The trick is to see beyond nicks and wobbles, color and intended purpose and to focus on potential. For example, a vintage leather trunk encased in Lucite works as a stunning coffee table. Pages from old books wallpaper a foyer. A cushion fashioned from a baseball diamond&rsquo;s home plate makes a garden chair comfortable.</p>

<h2>1. Dressing The Man &ndash; Alan Flusser</h2>

<p>It was written in 2002 and contains everything you want to know about classic men&rsquo;s style. It has beautiful photographs, illustration, very good text, it has hands-on graphics that allow you to pick the right patterns, it explains what to do and what not to do and overall, Alan Flusser probably sold more books on classic men&rsquo;s style than any other author in the world.</p>

<p>Flusser also penned a bunch of other books including Clothes and the man and Style and the man. I believe dressing the man is the best one of all of them because the photography is superior, the layout is nice and it&rsquo;s also one of the most comprehensive books he wrote.&nbsp;<a href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=12980&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2F0060191449%2F%3Ftag%3Dgentsgaze-20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="">Dressing the man</a>&nbsp;was the second book I had in my&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/mens-fashion-book-library-guide/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Men’s Fashion Book Guide – 100 Books For Your Menswear Library">menswear library</a>&nbsp;and I cherish it to this day. Even though it was written in 2002, it&rsquo;s not outdated at this point which is probably one of the reasons it hasn&rsquo;t been republished.</p>

<p><a href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=12980&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2F3848008165%2F%3Ftag%3Dgentsgaze-20" rel="nofollow"><img alt="Der Gentleman - Bernhard Roetzel" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Der-Gentleman-Bernhard-Roetzel-675x900.webp" /></a></p>

<p>Der Gentleman &ndash;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/gentleman-bernhard-roetzel-interview/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="How To Dress Like a Gentleman – Interview with Bernhard Roetzel">Bernhard Roetzel</a></p>

<h2>2.&nbsp;Gentleman &ndash; Bernhard Roetzel</h2>

<p>It is a German book and it was the first book I ever had that started it all for me. At the time it was written, it was the first and only book of its kind and probably because of that, it was really popular. The author, although German, is an Anglophile and because of that, you can see the British style in that book as well. If you look at the table of contents, it covers a wide array of classic men&rsquo;s things including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-many-suits-does-a-man-need/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="How Many Suits Does A Gentleman Need?">suits</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/five-dress-shoes-you-need/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="The First 5 Dress Shoes You Need to Start a Shoe Collection">shoes</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-many-dress-shirts-do-you-need/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="How Many Dress Shirts Does a Man Need?">shirts</a>&nbsp;and so forth.</p>

<p>This book has been translated into 19 languages, has been published many times and is updated regularly. That latest edition, for example, is from 2016. The great thing is neither&nbsp;Dressing the man nor the&nbsp;<a href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=12980&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2F3848008165%2F%3Ftag%3Dgentsgaze-20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="">Gentleman</a>&nbsp;are breaking the bank and you can find new or used copies for not very much money. If I just had to buy two books those would be the two.</p>

<h2>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bespoke Menswear Tailoring For Gentlemen &ndash; Bernard Roetzel</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s likewise written by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/gentleman-bernhard-roetzel-interview/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="How To Dress Like a Gentleman – Interview with Bernhard Roetzel">Bernhard Roetzel</a>&nbsp;and it walks you through the entire process of choosing a fabric, cutting the pattern, having your fitting and getting your final garment. It also highlights a bunch of different tailors from across Europe so you get a better understanding of the different styles and what works for you. Last but not least, it also talks about other&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/bespoke-tailoring-basics/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Bespoke Tailoring Basics">bespoke</a>&nbsp;things such as bespoke shirts or bespoke ties and overall, if you&rsquo;re considering to get a made to measure garment or a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/ready-to-wear-made-measure-bespoke/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Ready-to-Wear, Made-to-Measure &amp; Bespoke – Terminology Explained">bespoke custom garment</a>, I think this is money well spent because you learn a lot about the process, the pitfalls, and the mistakes you can make, and even if you&rsquo;re not in the market for a custom garment yet, you just learn a lot about how garments are made traditionally and because of that, it&rsquo;s my number 3 pick.</p>

<p><a href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=12980&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2F0070554803%2F%3Ftag%3Dgentsgaze-20" rel="nofollow"><img alt="Esquire\'s Encyclopedia of 20th Century Men\'s Fashions" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Esquires-Encyclopedia-of-20th-Century-Mens-Fashions-675x900.webp" /></a></p>

<h2>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Esquire Encyclopedia Of 20th-Century Men&rsquo;s Fashion &ndash; O. E. Schoeffler</h2>

<p>That&rsquo;s quite a mouthful and even though it&rsquo;s so old, it&rsquo;s such a good book because it&rsquo;s very comprehensive and it&rsquo;s over 600 pages. Just look at the table of contents, it doesn&rsquo;t just talk about formal evening wear but also formal day wear and there is a chapter on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/vest-waistcoat-guide/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Vest &amp; Waistcoat Guide">waistcoats</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/evening-wear-tuxedo-black-tie-white-tie/cummerbunds" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">cummerbunds</a>, and other clothing. It&rsquo;s a fantastic book that has lots of illustrations as well as a glossary and a dictionary that really help you to find things quickly if you don&rsquo;t know what certain terminology means.</p>

<p>That aside, it&rsquo;s usually something you leave in your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/coffee-table-books-for-gentlemen/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Coffee Table Books for Gentlemen">coffee table</a>&nbsp;and read on a cold day in front of the fire. Sadly, this book is out of print and you can sometimes find it at libraries but more often than not, they sold it years ago. Because it&rsquo;s out of print, it often goes north of $1,000 per copy sometimes you&rsquo;re lucky and you may end up getting it for 100 or $200 so be patient and when the opportunity arises, definitely get a copy.</p>

<p><a href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=12980&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2F3150105773%2F%3Ftag%3Dgentsgaze-20" rel="nofollow"><img alt="Reclams Mode - Und Kostümlexicon - Ingrid Loschek" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Reclams-Mode-Und-Kostu%CC%88mlexicon-Ingrid-Loschek-1030x579.png" /></a></p>

<h2>5. Reclams Mode &ndash; Und Kost&uuml;mlexicon &ndash;&nbsp;Ingrid Loschek</h2>

<p>It was originally written by Ingrid Loschek who sadly died because of cancer but it&rsquo;s now continued by Gundula Wolter. The focus of this&nbsp;<a href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=12980&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2F3150105773%2F%3Ftag%3Dgentsgaze-20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="">encyclopedia</a>&nbsp;is not just men but also women and fashion and fashion history, in general. I found it extremely valuable and if you speak German, it&rsquo;s a no-brainer, get this book! If you don&rsquo;t speak German, you have two alternatives.</p>

<p>One is Fairchild encyclopedia of menswear which, as the name implies, just focuses on menswear but I don&rsquo;t find it nearly as good. Another good book is the fashion dictionary by Guido Vergani which is more fashion-forward nevertheless, you find lots of useful information. Not a book you would read in front of the fireplace but something to look up terminologies and things when you need them. Obviously, if you are in the classic menswear business, you produce a lot of content and because of that, encyclopedias and in-depth research literature is very important for us. For you as a style enthusiast, it may not be something you must have in your library.</p>

<p><a href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=12980&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2F0679421017%2F%3Ftag%3Dgentsgaze-20" rel="nofollow"><img alt="The Elegant Man: How to Construct the Ideal Wardrobe" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/The-Elegant-Man.webp" /></a></p>

<h2>6. The Elegant Man &ndash; Riccardo Villarosa &amp; Guiliano Angeli</h2>

<p>I put it on the list because it has a really comprehensive section about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/fabric-guide/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Fabric Guide">fabrics</a>. You don&rsquo;t just learn about worsteds and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/flannel-guide-fall-fabric/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="FLANNEL – The Original Woolen Fall Fabric">flannels</a>&nbsp;but also about things like the weaves and everything you need to know as a style enthusiast. On top of that, it covers all the basics of a classic man&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wardrobe-maintenance-essentials/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Wardrobe Maintenance Essentials">wardrobe</a>&nbsp;even though the style sections are a little dated because it was published in the 90s, it is overall a very solid performer with good basic knowledge and it&rsquo;s a book that should not be missing from your library.</p>

<p><a href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=12980&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2F3894792523%2F%3Ftag%3Dgentsgaze-20" rel="nofollow"><img alt="Alles Uber Herrenschuhe - Helge Sternke" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Alles-Uber-Herrenschuhe-Helge-Sternke-824x1030.jpg" /></a></p>

<h2>7.&nbsp;Alles &uuml;ber Herrenschuhe &ndash; Helge Sternke</h2>

<p>Another German one, Alles Uber Herrenschuhe by Helge Sternke. This monumental book title has everything about men&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shoes-boots-guide/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Shoes &amp; Boots Guide">shoes</a>, isn&rsquo;t perfect but it&rsquo;s definitely the most comprehensive attempt about anything there is to men&rsquo;s shoes. Learn about construction, different models, their history and if you speak German and like shoes, it should not miss from your bookshelf. It&rsquo;s also not cheap and retails for around 200 euros. Now if you speak English, I suggest you check out a book from Daszlo Vass about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-to-make-shoes/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="How To Make Shoes: From Cowhide Pelt To Goodyear Welt">Goodyear welted shoes</a>&nbsp;for men which is very educational about how shoes are made and it&rsquo;s something you can read and understand.</p>

<p><a href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=12980&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2F2080135368%2F%3Ftag%3Dgentsgaze-20" rel="nofollow"><img alt="History Of Men\'s Fashion - Farid Chenoune" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/History-Of-Mens-Fashion-Farid-Chenoune.png" /></a></p>

<h2>8.&nbsp;History Of Men&rsquo;s Fashion &ndash; Farid Chenoune</h2>

<p>Even though the author&rsquo;s French and he wrote it in French, there&rsquo;s also an English version of it. It has about 300 pages and talks about men&rsquo;s fashion history which is very interesting for someone like me who always likes to dig deeper and understand why certain elements in classic menswear evolved, why they remain and how did they come to be.</p>

<h2>9.&nbsp;Sharp Suits &ndash; Eric Musgrave</h2>

<p>I met Eric once at his club in London and he has been into men&rsquo;s clothing for the most part of his life. He is very knowledgeable and he put together a book just about the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-to-spot-a-quality-suit/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="How To Spot A Quality Suit">suit</a>, its history, the different silhouettes, the patterns, and since the suit is so central to classic elegance and style, I put it on my list.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Mercury-Dictionary-Of-Textile-Terms.png"><img alt="Mercury Dictionary Of Textile Terms" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Mercury-Dictionary-Of-Textile-Terms-1030x579.png" /></a></p>

<p>Mercury Dictionary Of Textile Terms</p>

<h2>10.&nbsp;Mercury Dictionary Of Textile Terms</h2>

<p>Now the 10th book on my list may surprise you, it&rsquo;s the Mercury dictionary of textile terms and it was published in the 1950s. So it&rsquo;s quite old but I love it because it&rsquo;s more than 500 pages of detailed information about anything related to cloth, fabric, textiles, yarns, they talk about the weaving patterns, the history, and anything else you wanted to know. That&rsquo;s particularly important for me as a menswear designer and creator because I want to understand how patterns and certain fabrics and styles came to be and what makes them different from others. For you, as a consumer, it&rsquo;s really not as useful.</p>

<h2>4. Bruce Boyer Books (True Style / Elegance)</h2>

<p>First, let me say I&rsquo;m a great admirer of Bruce and of all the authors I mentioned here, I think he has the best writing style. On top of that, he has a wonderful personal style. So why didn&rsquo;t it make my list?</p>

<p>One, his books have no photographs. Personally, I believe that classic men&rsquo;s style and clothing is best consumed in a visual way. I&rsquo;ve discussed this with Bruce Boyer personally in the past and he believes that nothing dates a book as quickly as having photos in it and while I agree with him on that front, I still think photos help the consumer to better understand what he&rsquo;s writing.</p>

<p>Two, a lot of what you can read in Bruce&rsquo;s books are individual articles that were written for magazines or different outlets. In his books, they&rsquo;re all combined and so sometimes I personally miss that coherence that you get when you write one book from start to finish. That being said, I have all of his books in my possession, I really enjoy them and I think you should invest in them too, they&rsquo;re just not my personal top 10.</p>

<h2>5. Hugo Jacomet Books</h2>

<p>You may know him as the Parisian Gentleman. In recent years, he has published a book Parisian Gentleman as well as the Italian Gentleman. Both books are beautiful, they are large oversized coffee table books with beautiful photographs, and I think overall, it&rsquo;s something you should invest in. At the same time, those books are more focused on craftsman and different houses as well as their history.&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally, I don&rsquo;t care as much about the history of the people but more about the products they create. Because of that, Parisian Gentleman was not in my top ten list. &nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=12980&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2F1784880973%2F%3Ftag%3Dgentsgaze-20" rel="nofollow"><img alt="Tailoring obsessions - Simon Crompton" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Tailoring-obsessions-Simon-Crompton-687x1030.jpg" /></a></p>

<h2>6. Simon Crompton Books</h2>

<p>I think&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/interview-simon-crompton-permanent-style/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Permanent Style Interview with Simon Crompton">Simon Crompton</a>&nbsp;has a great wealth of knowledge, very detailed, very in-depth, he really understands bespoke and has visited many craftsmen. At the same time, his books either focus on brands which again, I&rsquo;m not so interested in, because I know all of those brands already I know their benefits and their shortcomings and so there&rsquo;s not much value there for me. Simon also speaks about things that are not primarily about brands but about clothing, style, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/bespoke-tailoring-basics/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Bespoke Tailoring Basics">tailoring</a>. The problem with those is they&rsquo;re not as comprehensive as the information that you can find on his website. I know that&rsquo;s often the fault of the publisher not of Simon Crompton but at the end of the day, if I invest money in a book, I want more information than what I can get free online.</p>

<p>Of course, if you like his writings on the website, buying his book is a great way to support him. That being said, if you want to learn from real-world outfits and get information you can not find on his website, I suggest to buy his book, The Style Guide because it shows you men from this day and age that wear things and he explains why it works for them in a particular situation and so you can draw conclusions from that for your own outfits.</p>

<h2>Your Beard is Not &ldquo;Patchy&rdquo; &ndash; It&rsquo;s just growing</h2>

<p>Most men cut their growth short when they start noticing that parts of the beard are coming in thicker, or if parts are just patchy or not growing in at all. Believe it or not, this is completely normal. Your beard isn&rsquo;t patchy. It&rsquo;s just growing.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/beard-facial-hair-guide/" title="Beard &amp; Facial Hair Guide">Beards take some time to grow in</a>. If you&rsquo;re not quick to grow a consistent beard, it&rsquo;s best to start growing it just before going on vacation, when you can justify not&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/ebooks-posters-courses-media/shaving-guide-ebook">shaving</a>&nbsp;for a while. You may even decide to take a &ldquo;beardcation&rdquo; just to help grow out the beard without looking awkward at the office. If you have holidays coming up, stop&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shaving101-pre-shave-skincare/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">shaving</a>&nbsp;a day or two beforehand; hopefully by the time you return to work, the beard will be distinguishable as a beard, and it won&rsquo;t look like you were too lazy to shave.</p>

<h2>The First Month of Not Shaving</h2>

<p>For most men, beards only start to fully connect without glaring patches after a full month of growth. That&rsquo;s the average, though for some it may take longer.</p>

<p>This is why a beard is a commitment. Growing it out takes patience and some work. You&rsquo;ll be dealing with a few issues:</p>

<ol>
<li>Patchy and unkempt facial hair that looks like you just forgot to shave.</li>
<li>Itchiness.</li>
<li>Coarse hair your significant other may dislike.</li>
<li>Having to deal with people commenting or staring because you look a little rough around the edges.</li>
</ol>

<p>As soon as you start&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-to-grow-beard-itchy-skin/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">growing your beard</a>, there are a couple of things you should consider doing to keep it healthy:</p>

<ol>
<li>Wash it regularly. Keep it hydrated, but don&rsquo;t over-wash the beard. Just like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/hairstyles-for-men-haircuts/">your hair</a>, it doesn&rsquo;t need to be washed daily, or you run the risk of drying it out.</li>
<li>Immediately begin&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/beard-care-grooming-guide/" title="Beard Care and Grooming Guide: Products and Tools">applying beard oil</a>&nbsp;to keep it soft, prevent excessive itching and keep it healthy.</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Growing-a-beard-takes-commitment-and-will-grow-out-eventually.webp"><img alt="Growing a beard takes commitment and will grow out eventually" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Growing-a-beard-takes-commitment-and-will-grow-out-eventually-900x675.webp" /></a></p>

<p>Growing a beard takes commitment and will grow out eventually</p>

<p>After the first month has passed, you have two options. Either commit to growing a beard that might land you on&nbsp;<a href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=12980&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dduck%2Bdynasty%26rh%3Dn%253A2625373011%26dc%26qid%3D1554301630%26rnid%3D2941120011%26ref%3Dsr_nr_n_1" rel="nofollow">Duck Dynasty</a>&nbsp;or start grooming the beard to look more polished.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/grooming-shaving-guide/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Grooming</a>&nbsp;can be done from the start, but the risk of starting too early is that you won&rsquo;t have the chance to see how your beard falls along its natural lines. This can be problematic for some men who misjudge how their beard will grow, and then have to grow out an area they have trimmed or shaved.</p>

<p>If after the first month, you still notice glaring patches or a lack of density in certain areas, you may need to give it a bit of extra help. There is good news, however. If you have trouble growing a full beard easily, chances are you don&rsquo;t have to worry about going bald. Studies have shown that most men who easily grow beards from a young age are more prone to male pattern baldness than men who have difficulty growing a beard.</p>

<h2>How to Help Your Beard Grow</h2>

<p>So, how does one grow a beard that&rsquo;s giving you a hard time?</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s debunk some myths.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/It-is-a-process-to-get-it-to-a-comfortable-length.webp"><img alt="It is a process to get it to a comfortable length" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/It-is-a-process-to-get-it-to-a-comfortable-length-684x900.webp" /></a></p>

<p>It is a process to get it to a comfortable length</p>

<h3>Your Beard is Not Growing Slowly</h3>

<p>Your beard actually grows at the same rate as every other man, unless you have some kind of skin condition.</p>

<h3>The Patches Are Caused By Thickness, Not Length</h3>

<p>There are a couple of attributes that cause some beards to look denser and others to look patchy.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-to-find-colors-for-skintone/">lighter</a>&nbsp;hair, it will almost always appear thinner than someone with dark hair.</li>
<li>Like the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/healthy-hair-tips-for-men/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">hair</a>&nbsp;on your head, facial hair can be thick or thin, and thicker facial hair always appears fuller.</li>
</ul>

<p>Fact: You cannot make your beard grow faster, but you can make the hair appear or even grow thicker.</p>

<p>Start trimming after about four weeks</p>

<h2>Here are a few tricks and tips:</h2>

<h3>Don&rsquo;t Shave It</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/biggest-shaving-mistakes/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Shaving</a>&nbsp;a beard does not cause it to grow back thicker or faster. The only way to grow a majestic beard is by actually making the commitment to let it grow. You&rsquo;ll get there.</p>

<h3>Exercise</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/gym-etiquette-guide-men/">Exercising</a>&nbsp;and losing weight increases testosterone and blood circulation which both have a huge effect on facial hair growth. Short, but intense workouts will cause testosterone to increase faster and will also prevent it from declining.&nbsp;Testosterone and beard growth go hand in hand, so head to the gym and break a sweat to see thicker&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/beard-growth-and-hair-loss-eric-bandholz/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Beard Growth &amp; Preventing Hair Loss with Eric Bandholz">beard growth</a>.</p>

<h3>Get a Good Night&rsquo;s Sleep</h3>

<p>In order to remain healthy, we require sleep. The old saying &ldquo;maybe you&rsquo;ll feel better in the morning&rdquo; is like saying &ldquo;maybe if you turn it off and back on again, it will work.&rdquo; One study in 2011 by the Journal of the American Medical Association said that if you sleep for 5 hours or less, your testosterone levels will decrease by as much as 15 percent. In other words,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/mens-pajama-primer/">go to bed</a>!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Patchy-beards-are-part-of-growing-it-out-but-it-doesnt-have-to-be-this-bad.webp"><img alt="Patchy beards are part of growing it out but it doesnt have to be this bad" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Patchy-beards-are-part-of-growing-it-out-but-it-doesnt-have-to-be-this-bad-900x506.webp" /></a></p>

<p>Patchy beards are part of growing it out but it doesn&rsquo;t have to be this bad</p>

<h3>Minimize Stress and Anxiety</h3>

<p>Stress has been shown to constrict blood vessels and some evidence even points to cortisol reducing testosterone levels. The same way you can lose hair due to stress, it can also prevent you from growing your beard out.</p>

<h3>Eat Well</h3>

<p>A healthy and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/foods-from-around-the-world/">well-balanced diet</a>&nbsp;is key to growing facial hair. Vitamin, protein, and mineral rich diets are a great way to grower thicker hair.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/You-may-look-unkempt-at-the-office-for-awhile-its-just-part-of-the-process.webp"><img alt="You may look unkempt at the office for awhile its just part of the process" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/You-may-look-unkempt-at-the-office-for-awhile-its-just-part-of-the-process-900x675.webp" /></a></p>

<p>You may look unkempt at the office for awhile its just part of the process</p>

<h3>Consider Taking Some Vitamins</h3>

<p>Taking supplements like iron; vitamin B, D, and E; magnesium; zinc and copper can all increase hair thickness. Check with your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/dressing-the-doctor-classic-wardrobe/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Dressing the Doctor: A Physician’s Guide to a Classic Wardrobe">doctor</a>&nbsp;before taking any over the counter supplements. There are even some out there that are designed specifically for beard growth, but since supplements are a highly unregulated industry, be prepared that they might not work.</p>

<h3>Use the Proper Tools</h3>

<h3>Give Yourself a Break</h3>

<p>We all know a big part of how fast our beard grows in is caused by simple genetics, but unlike some aspects such as your height, your beard will keep growing. It may take a little bit of time, but if you make the commitment, you will be rewarded with a lush and majestic beard.</p>

<p>If for whatever reason, you aren&rsquo;t growing any facial hair, that&rsquo;s a whole other issue, and you make require medical treatment to fix it.</p>

<h3>Fixing Glaring Patches</h3>

<p>If you can&rsquo;t justify waiting for all the hair to grow out, and you need to fix glaring patches, the only quick way is to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-to-trim-a-beard/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="How to Trim a Beard">trim</a>&nbsp;the entire beard down to the length of the lowest patch.

<h2>How To Choose The Right Hair Product For Your Hair Type</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SRS-hair-prior-to-styling.jpg"><img alt="Sven Raphael Schneider\'s unstyled hair" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SRS-hair-prior-to-styling-900x601.jpg" /></a></p>

<h3>Analyze Your Hair Type</h3>

<p>Hair types can be straight, wavy, curly, or kinky, all of which can be thin or thick. For example, I have coarse, thick, and voluminous hair that is quite dry so I need a product that tames my hair without drying it out. As a kid, I had curls and if I let my hair grow, it definitely becomes&nbsp;more wavy. For me, I always use hair products with an extreme hold, otherwise, my hair just does whatever it wants. On the other hand, if you have thin, sparse, or straight hair, you do not want a product without a hold, otherwise, it&rsquo;s weighing your hair down.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Frankly, it&rsquo;s best to talk to your barber or to your hairstylist because they have more experience and they can tell you what kind of hair you got.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/James-Dean.webp"><img alt="James Dean\'s signature hairstyle." src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/James-Dean-900x598.webp" /></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/gentleman-style-james-dean/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">James Dean&rsquo;</a>s signature hairstyle.</p>

<h3>Decide On The Style You Want</h3>

<p>Basically, that means what do you want your hair to look like. Do you want to have beach hair that is wavy and stands up? Do you want something that I have that is relatively stiff and very neat and gentlemanly? Do you want your hair to be flexible or loose or just very much in place? do you want a matte and textured look? or do you want a smooth and shiny look? Should be obvious or should be subtle? These are all questions that you have to answer for yourself. Again, it pays to talk to your stylist and look at different photos and see what you like and dislike.</p>

<h3>Take A Stylist&rsquo;s Advice With A Grain Of Salt</h3>

<p>As I mentioned before, a stylist knows your hair, they have a good comparison, they&rsquo;ve tried different things, and they know what works for a certain type of hair and what doesn&rsquo;t. On the flip side, they have a serious conflict of interest simply because if you think about your haircut right, doing your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-to-get-best-haircut-for-face-shape/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">haircut</a>&nbsp;takes them 30, 40, or 50 minutes. Now, by selling you a product, they can make twice as much or maybe even more money just by selling that product in an additional two minutes. Therefore, stylists aren&rsquo;t really objective about what they&rsquo;re selling you. Chances are they want to sell you something that is ideal for your hair that they have right there at the store.</p>

<p>In some salons and barbershops, they are trying to tell you that the products they have from a certain brand are different than if you buy them at Costco for example, however, there is no evidence that suggests that the J. Crew product you buy at your barbershop is any different than the one you buy at your drugstore.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Get-a-Trim-at-the-Barbershop.webp"><img alt="Your regular stylist can help you out when it comes to your hair" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Get-a-Trim-at-the-Barbershop-900x597.webp" /></a></p>

<p>Your regular stylist can help you out when it comes to your hair</p>

<p>In general, anything related to hair is a very high margin product so always keep it in mind when you buy something. Also, don&rsquo;t be afraid to question and ask your stylist about specifics. The sales pitch may go like this, &ldquo;This product has much higher quality ingredients that are much more concentrated without any filler materials, also it only uses essential oils and leaves out all the bad chemicals&rdquo;. Good questions to ask are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Why is this product the better quality?</li>
<li>Why is this one ingredient better than the others?</li>
<li>Which chemicals exactly are left out?</li>
<li>What is the concentration in this product?</li>
</ul>

<p>If they can&rsquo;t answer those questions or if they are not willing to tell you to answer them later and do some research, it&rsquo;s nothing more but an empty sales pitch.</p>

<p>These are not trademarked or defined terms and every brand may use them slightly differently. So for one brand, pomade is kind of a wax based product with fat that you smear in your hair; for others, it&rsquo;s completely waxless, water soluble, and just different altogether. Because of that, it&rsquo;s very difficult for you, as a consumer, to do an apples-to-apples comparison simply based on the type of product you have. Yes, a spray is a spray but some may be aerosol sprays, others may be a pump spray which can be hugely different in their effect on your hair.</p>

<p>So what should you do instead? I suggest you look at the characteristics of each hair product which is hold, body, and shine. Every hair product will have different strengths in different areas and this is what matters most to your hair. With hold, I mean, how long does a specific product hold that hairstyle throughout the day no matter it&rsquo;s really sunny, windy, or rainy? With body, I mean how much volume does a hair product add to your hair? By shine, I mean how reflective is your hair going to be in terms of light? Do you want it to sparkle or do you want it to be very matte? Now, even though I just said every hair product type is slightly different, we still try to create an infographic that fits 95% of the hair products out there and you can find it on our website here.</p>

<h3>Evaluate The Ingredients Of Hair Products</h3>

<p>As with pretty much anything, as a consumer, you have to be educated so you can cut through the marketing speech and make sure you get the best value product for your hair. Now you may wonder how do I do that? I have no clue about hair, where do I start making an informed decision? Honestly, the best place for information on hair products that I found is the Environmental Working Group Skin Deep Cosmetics Database. Yes, that is a mouthful but guess what? This wasn&rsquo;t made by marketers but by scientists hence the tongue breaker name. Even though the name suggests, it just covers cosmetics, it covers hair products as well and has overall more than 70,000 products that were analyzed in detail. All you have to do is type in your product brand and the product name and then it will show you if it contains any hazardous materials, what the composition is, and also if there are other products that are may be related but better.</p>

<p>Personally to me, it was reveling even just typing in big brands like Jack Black, or J Crew, Paul Mitchell, or Redken and realizing that these brands that are always praised as something really special are maybe not quite as good as you thought they were. Overall, it gave me a much better idea of what kind of stuff I put in my hair whether it makes sense for the hair type I have and the style I&rsquo;m going for and what other products are out there that are much better.</p>

<h3>Experiment With Different Hair Products</h3>

<p>I really urge you to experiment with different hair products. Yes, the database can really help you to narrow things down to a certain group of products but and ultimately, you still have to wear it in your hair and decide if it&rsquo;s something you want or if the look is just not right. No matter if you buy online or the retail store, chances are you&rsquo;ll just have to invest some money to get some of the products. Very rarely are you allowed to return products that you&rsquo;ve already used but it may make sense to ask beforehand what the return policy is with specific retailers. Of course, if they allow you to return things, chances are their prices are gonna be a little higher because they have to beat that cost. Now, if you buy a product from your stylist, you have the chance to just try it out in your hair maybe after a haircut without having to buy it so that&rsquo;s a great opportunity to test things out without having to spend extra money.</p>

<h3>g&ouml;t2b Spiking Gel for Thick, Textured Hair</h3>

<p><img alt="side view, Sven Raphael Schneider\'s styled disconnected udnercut" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/side-view-SRS-styled-undercut-900x601.jpg" /></p>

<p>Sven Raphael Schneider&rsquo;s styled disconnected undercut with&nbsp;<a href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=12980&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07DRRBD87%2F%3Ftag%3Dgentsgaze-20" rel="nofollow">g&ouml;t2b Spiking Glue</a>&nbsp;hair gel</p>

<p>Gentleman&rsquo;s Gazette founder Sven Raphael Schneider, tried pomade for a while until he realized he suffered from pomade acne. However, he has very thick, stubborn hair and so he was looking for an alternative product that allowed him to create a nice look with a part that would keep his hair in place.</p>

<p><a href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=12980&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07DRRBD87%2F%3Ftag%3Dgentsgaze-20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="got2b Spiking Glue Hair Gel" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/got2b-Spiking-Glue-Hair-Gel-1030x1030.jpeg" /></a></p>

<p>After experimenting for over 6 months, it turned out that the water-soluble spiking glue gel from g&ouml;t2b was the only gel strong enough to keep his hair in place. Interestingly, other g&ouml;t2b products did not work for him at all. He has been using the gel in the yellow tube for nearly 10 years, and his hair looks great. Even better,&nbsp;<a href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=12980&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07DRRBD87%2F%3Ftag%3Dgentsgaze-20" rel="nofollow">g&ouml;t2b Spiking Glue</a>&nbsp;is cheap and since it is made by Henkel, it should be available around the globe.</p>

<h3>Groom &amp; Clean for Thin, Straight Hair</h3>

<p>Though not as well known as Brylcreem, Groom &amp; Clean is a classic product from the 1950&rsquo;s that is still a great product for men today, and it&rsquo;s the favorite of GG&rsquo;s Content Director, Preston Schlueter. Unlike it&rsquo;s more famous cousins, pomade and Brylcreem, it contains no wax and is therefore easy to wash out in a single washing.&nbsp;<a href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=12980&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB01IA9D8CO%2F%3Ftag%3Dgentsgaze-20" rel="nofollow">Groom &amp; Clean</a>&nbsp;is&nbsp;an emulsion&nbsp;of water and mineral oil that also contains lanolin, a naturally derived oil, for moisture and hold. It has a pleasant but minimal scent fades quickly after application. developed in the late 50&rsquo;s; easily touched up with a wet comb</p>

<p><a href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=12980&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB01IA9D8CO%2F%3Ftag%3Dgentsgaze-20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img alt="Groom &amp; Clean " src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Groom-Clean-Crop-1030x407.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>It feels like a slightly tacky lotion and with a small amount, it will provide you with a light hold that is pliable all day long, or with larger amounts will result in a high shine with a medium to&nbsp;strong hold. It&rsquo;s extremely versatile and is easily washed out without any sweat or tears. Long hair or short,&nbsp;<a href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=12980&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB01IA9D8CO%2F%3Ftag%3Dgentsgaze-20" rel="nofollow">Groom &amp; Clean</a>&nbsp;is well worth trying &ndash; and it&rsquo;s inexpensive to boot.</p>

<p>I urge you to check out the Environmental Working Group&rsquo;s Skin Deep Cosmetics Database. That is really the first step and if you go down that path, you&rsquo;ll have to invest a few hours but you&rsquo;ll be armed with more information and you know exactly what&rsquo;s good for your hair and what is not.</p>',

<h2>The Disconnected Undercut</h2>

<p>One of the most popular hairstyles today, and it was popularized by shows like Boardwalk Empire or lately,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/peaky-blinders-suits-style/" target="_blank" title="Gentlemen of Style: The Kingpins of Peaky Blinders">Peaky Blinders</a>. The best part about it is that you can style it in many different ways. Apart from that, it always makes a statement. It&rsquo;s a very classic style, but it can be modern at the same time.</p>

<p><img alt="Classic modern disconnected undercut" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Classic-Modern-Disconnected-Undercut-600x900.jpg" style="height:900px; width:600px" /></p>

<p>Classic modern disconnected undercut</p>

<p>Basically, it&rsquo;s defined as closely shaven sides with long hair on top and no or minimal fade. In this case, I have enough for a side part and I have it in a very classic style that&rsquo;s more gentleman oriented from the 1920&rsquo;s and 30&rsquo;s. So before you can style it, you need to have the right cut. Look at my hair when it&rsquo;s unstyled. Not quite what you expected isn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<p>So how do you explain this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-to-get-best-haircut-for-face-shape/" target="_blank" title="How to Get The Best Haircut For Your Face Shape">haircut</a>&nbsp;to your barber? The best way to do it is to bring a picture of what you want ideally, and if he cannot recreate that, it&rsquo;s time to change your barber.</p>

<p>In case a family member or a friend is cutting your hair, here is what you should do. First, you need a clipper, and you should choose the number one attachment which is the closest to getting a shave. I had my last haircut about two weeks ago, so my hair&rsquo;s a little longer, but usually, with clipper number 1, I get exactly the right length so it grows out nicely.</p>

<p><img alt="distinct line between the long hair and short sides" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SRS-side-view-disconnected-undercut-900x601.jpg" style="height:601px; width:900px" /></p>

<p>distinct line between the long hair and short sides</p>

<p>Basically, you want a distinct line between the long hair on top and the short sides. As you can see, it has to be straight. In order to get that result, I need to have my&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/long-hair-style/" target="_blank" title="The Long Hair Style Guide">long hair</a>&nbsp;up so I can get the proper line. To do that, you can either use a clip or a hair band to just keep them up so you can make sure everything is straight.</p>

<p><img alt="Use a hair band to ensure that the line will be straight" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/SRS-disconnected-undercut-900x601.jpg" style="height:601px; width:900px" /></p>

<p>Use a hair band to ensure that the line will be straight</p>

<p>Once you&rsquo;re done with the sides, you want to cut the top of your hair to an even length. In my case, right now it&rsquo;s about 9cm or 3 1/2 inches. I would suggest not to go shorter than 7cm or 2.75 inches because otherwise, the distinction between the short sides and your top just is not as pronounced anymore and it&rsquo;s not a disconnected undercut.</p>

<p>Personally, with my thick, coarse hair, that&rsquo;s as long as I can go otherwise, I have trouble styling it. If you have finer hair or thinner hair, you can definitely go a lot longer and still get a nice undercut style.</p>

<p><img alt="pompadour inspired disconnected undercut" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Pompadour-Inspired-Disconnected-Undercut-900x600.jpg" style="height:600px; width:900px" /></p>

<p>pompadour-inspired disconnected undercut</p>

<p>The advantage of this haircut is that it can be styled in many ways; you can create a vintage look, or a 90&rsquo;s look, or a rocker look, and it really all depends on what products you use.</p>

<p>The style was popular with close cut sides in the 1910&rsquo;s, 20&rsquo;s, 30&rsquo;s and the 40&rsquo;s. In the late 40&rsquo;s and 50&rsquo;s, they had a style, the so-called quiff top. Today&rsquo;s disconnected undercut is a combination of these styles and there&rsquo;s also a lot of different influences in there and basically, you can do whatever you want.</p>

<p>1.&nbsp;<strong>Pomade</strong>. Pomade is basically a wax based on paraffin or glycerin and it&rsquo;s very thick and I used to do it when I started out with this hairstyle. The problem is, some people get what is called &ldquo;pomade acne&rdquo; so I ended up with lots of zits all over my forehead and it was a mess. On top of that, it greased up our pillow sheets and my wife complained constantly. That aside, if the strongest pomade wasn&rsquo;t strong enough for my hair, and it was wavy. So overall,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/pomade-guide-test-murrays-georgia-brown-royal-crown/" target="_blank" title="Pomade Guide &amp; Hair Product Test: Sweet Georgia Brown, Murray’s &amp; Royal Crown">pomade</a>&nbsp;was not the solution.</p>

<p>If you have thinner hair, you may get away with a styling cream that provides a little bit of hold, and you can shape it in any way, shape, or form. For me, it just doesn&rsquo;t work because I have coarse, thick hair.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve tested many&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/best-hair-products-men/" target="_blank" title="Best Hair Products For Men &amp; More">hair products</a>&nbsp;over the years and eventually, I found this one which really worked for me which is the&nbsp;<a href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=12980&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB00LSB824Q%2F%3Ftag%3Dgentsgaze-20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">got 2 b from Schwarzkopf</a>.</p>

<p>2.&nbsp;<strong>High-quality comb</strong>. Most people buy rather inexpensive combs for a dollar or less that are made out of injection molded plastic, and the problem is, they have little ridges and actually can hurt your hair. It&rsquo;s also much more difficult to get the comb through your hair.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m using a quality hard rubber comb which is also acetate. It glides through your hair like butter, and it doesn&rsquo;t damage your hair so invest a few more bucks in a quality comb.</p>

<p>3.&nbsp;<strong>Hair dryer</strong>. You can use a regular, store-brand, nothing fancy, just has to get hot if you want to dry your hair quickly and you need a certain amount of power, not too much, so it actually dries.</p>

<ul>
<li>I always start with freshly washed hair because just making it wet is not enough, at least in my case. It&rsquo;s too thick, and it&rsquo;s much more difficult to style it right. At the same time, you don&rsquo;t want your hair to be too wet otherwise, it takes too long, and you may get waves in your hair. Once I wash my hair, I make sure to dry it thoroughly. You can also use a second towel if it&rsquo;s not dry enough.</li>
<li>Now, it&rsquo;s time for some gel. Like I said, you want stuff that is white. I&rsquo;ll take about this much, for the amount of hair I have. Don&rsquo;t skimp on it, if you don&rsquo;t use enough, you&rsquo;ll lack the hold especially, if you have thick, coarse hair. I rub it in both hands and apply it to my hair. Usually, I start with one first, just get it in there, all the way down, not just on top. You definitely want to get all of your long hair, you really need to absorb it. Alright, now it&rsquo;s time to wash your hands otherwise, everything will be sticky and it&rsquo;ll be a mess.</li>
</ul>

<p>Disconnected undercut side part</p>

<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s time to choose your part. Personally, I like it either here or here. Usually, I don&rsquo;t go all the way to the sides. It&rsquo;s always something you may want to do if you have a receding hairline. I avoid center parts because it makes you look like from the Adams family.An easy way to get your part right is to comb it back on the side you want the part to be and simply go in straight and go up. Now, you simply comb it to one side and then the other, so you get a nice part.</li>
<li>At this stage, your part is not perfect and you simply do it from the other way. Sometimes, it&rsquo;s great the first time but usually, when you start out, it&rsquo;s not. Now I go slightly to the side, not in the exact line otherwise, it will never be straight but just a tiny amount to the left or right and it&rsquo;ll be a much smoother, straighter line. Once at the end, I hold my hair like this so I know what side it&rsquo;s on then I comb the other part over so I get exactly what I want. Once I&rsquo;m done with the part, you have this result.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Next, up, I comb my hair down and to the side and the back, exactly where I want it to be. At this stage, it&rsquo;s time for the hair dryer, normally, I choose the warm setting which is not too hot but also not cool because that way it dries faster and I use the medium setting because otherwise, it will just blow my hair all over the place and it&rsquo;s harder to style it. First, I start with the shorter side because it&rsquo;s easier. Basically, I dry my hair and follow with a comb so I get nice, straight hair lines and I get it to settle in the place I wanted to.</li>
</ul>

<p>Gentleman&rsquo;s Gazette style &ndash; disconnected undercut</p>

<ul>
<li>Now, the short side is much easier than the wider side because you have a lot more hair. There are 2 ways to do this, you can comb and use your fan into one strand all the way at a time or you go along the part first and slightly move over until they&rsquo;re all done. You can choose whatever works for you. For me, with my thick and coarse hair, it&rsquo;s better to do it slowly from the part away. At this stage, I also use the hot setting simply to get it to dry faster.</li>
<li>Once you have your hair in a shape you roughly want it to be, it&rsquo;s time to use your hands and leave the comb behind. I do this because otherwise, I&rsquo;ll get hair sticking out especially in the back and I want to avoid that. With my hands, I can hold my hair down while using a hair dryer and smooth it all out. If you get hair standing up, simply use some water, make it wet, put it back on, maybe use a little gel and use your hair dryer again.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you&rsquo;re happy with the look and your hair is flat, you&rsquo;re basically done. Voila! The disconnected undercut, Gentleman&rsquo;s Gazette style.</p>

<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>

<p>Before you decide to go with this haircut, you should think about what exactly do you want, how long you want it on top, do you really want to shorten the side? Do you want a slight fade or not? And how are you going to wear it? What are you going to wear it with?</p>',

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Dft7PimrUEs/hqdefault.jpg" style="height:360px; width:480px" /></p>

<p><strong>Sven Raphael Schneider:</strong>&nbsp;Good, let&rsquo;s roll!</p>

<p><strong>Barron Cuadro:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah</p>

<p><strong>Tanner Guzy:</strong>&nbsp;Sweet baby!</p>

<p><strong>Brock McGoff:</strong>&nbsp;So, we are going to get to know each other a little bit today.</p>

<p><strong>SRS:</strong>&nbsp;Exactly.</p>

<h3><strong>If You Had To Choose One Of Your Senses To Live Without, Which One Would It Be?</strong></h3>

<p><strong>BC:</strong>&nbsp;We were kind of talking about this earlier. I think taste is a good option, because I want all my other senses. I think being blind probably would be the worst, right?</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;Being blind will be the worst than having no sense of touch. That&rsquo;d be tough.</p>

<p><strong>BC:</strong>&nbsp;That&rsquo;s hard.</p>

<p><strong>BM:</strong>&nbsp;But blind you will have to rethink your whole career.</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;No, no, no that&rsquo;s just your pitch. I&rsquo;m like the blind style guide.</p>

<p><strong>SRS:</strong>&nbsp;Alright.</p>

<p><strong>BM:</strong>&nbsp;Blindstyle.com, right?</p>

<p><strong>SRS:</strong>&nbsp;Well, I love food so definitely not taste. I think maybe smell, even though I like steak and you know it tastes good. But it&rsquo;s actually smell, so I think I&rsquo;d go with that and I never have to smell any farts again.</p>

<p><strong>BM:</strong>&nbsp;If you could choose which sense your wife loses? If you know what I mean.</p>

<p><strong>SRS:</strong>&nbsp;That&rsquo;s a good question. Tanner?</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;Probably smell too for all those same reasons, although I do love the sweet pungent smell of relief.</p>

<p><strong>BM:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, I&rsquo;d give up taste for sure and just eat more vegetables.</p>

<p><strong>SRS:</strong>&nbsp;One way to do it right? I like the taste of green.</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s probably somebody somewhere who has done that where they were just like, &ldquo;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/dressing-the-doctor-classic-wardrobe/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Dressing the Doctor: A Physician’s Guide to a Classic Wardrobe">Doctor</a>, scrape of my taste buds. I just want to eat healthy food for the rest of my life. I don&rsquo;t want to deal with that anymore.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>BM:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah.</p>

<p><img alt="Michael Douglas in the movie The Game" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Michael-Douglas-in-the-movie-The-Game-1030x571.png" style="height:571px; width:1030px" /></p>

<p>Michael Douglas in the movie The Game</p>

<h3><strong>If You Could Live In A Book, TV Show Or Movie, Which One Would It Be?</strong></h3>

<p><strong>SRS:</strong>&nbsp;Oh man, I have to think about that one.</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;I would be Michael Westen from Burn Notice.</p>

<p><strong>BC:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, alright.</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;This is a show that I know is not a great show, but it&rsquo;s got Bruce Campbell in it. It&rsquo;s intentionally campy and kind of dopey and I think it would be awesome to be Michael Weston from Burn Notice. I would be a killer spy.</p>

<p><strong>BM:</strong>&nbsp;For the record, Tanner has talked about Burn Notice several times.</p>

<p><img alt="Michael Westen in Burn Notice" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Michael-Westen-at-Burn-Notice-1030x577.png" style="height:577px; width:1030px" /></p>

<p>Michael Westen in Burn Notice</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s ridiculous, right? Like ridiculous, but my wife and I are going through this for like the 5th time now and so this is kind of where my mind is.</p>

<p><strong>BC:</strong>&nbsp;I think what would be great will be Neal Caffrey from White Collar.</p>

<p><strong>Everyone:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah.</p>

<p><strong>SRS:</strong>&nbsp;I think maybe, Michael Douglas in The Game. Having that thrill, that would be amazing I think for the first time.</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;Also Batman.</p>

<p><strong>BM:</strong>&nbsp;Oh yeah! Which Batman though?</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;Oh definitely like George Clooney.</p>

<p><strong>BM:</strong>&nbsp;Oh Clooney?</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;No, I&rsquo;m kidding!</p>

<p><strong>BM:</strong>&nbsp;Jump, cut. Tanner is out of the video.</p>

<p><img alt="Pierce Brosnan at Thomas Crown Affair" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Perice-Brosnan-at-Thomas-Crown-Affair-1030x569.png" style="height:569px; width:1030px" /></p>

<p>Pierce Brosnan at Thomas Crown Affair</p>

<p><strong>SRS:</strong>&nbsp;I think Thomas Crown from Thomas Crown Affair.</p>

<p><strong>Everyone:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah.</p>

<p><strong>SRS:</strong>&nbsp;That for me would be like awesome.</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah the defaults are like Bond or Indiana Jones or Captain America or somebody else and but Thomas Crown there&rsquo;s just a little bit more believability to something like that.</p>

<p><strong>SRS:</strong>&nbsp;And honestly, I like the second version more than the first one. A lot of people are like the Steve McQueen one was cooler.</p>

<p><strong>BM:</strong>&nbsp;I like the second one too!</p>

<p><strong>SRS:</strong>&nbsp;I&rsquo;m more like the Pierce Brosnan one, I personally like that.</p>

<p><strong>BM:</strong>&nbsp;I actually like Pierce Brosnan as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/james-bond-his-tuxedo/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="James Bond &amp; His Tuxedo">James Bond</a>&nbsp;and I know that&rsquo;s terrible. I like him as an actor.</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;The movies were bad, but Brosnan was a good Bond.</p>

<p><strong>BM:</strong>&nbsp;He was a good fit.</p>

<h3><strong>If You Could Get Away With A Crime, What Would It Be?</strong></h3>

<p><strong>BM:</strong>&nbsp;Boy, I&rsquo;m glad everybody has to think about this one a little bit.</p>

<p><strong>SRS:</strong>&nbsp;Could get away with a crime&hellip;.</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;Man&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>SRS:</strong>&nbsp;Really what the crime would most likely be?</p>

<p><strong>BM:</strong>&nbsp;I guess, would it be robbing a bank, would it be a heist, would you kill a man?</p>

<p><strong>SRS:</strong>&nbsp;I think I&rsquo;d like more the smart crime. You know having a nice little set up, maybe like Thomas Crown, setting something up and getting some art.</p>

<p><img alt="Sven Raphael Schneider" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Sven-Raphael-Schneider-687x1030.jpg" style="height:1030px; width:687px" /></p>

<p>Sven Raphael Schneider &ndash; If I would commit a crime, it would be a smart crime</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;So a heist.</p>

<p><strong>SRS:</strong>&nbsp;That would be like my kind of crime. How would I do it? Boy, set up a game plan and be very sneaky.</p>

<p><strong>BC:</strong>&nbsp;Some Filipinos maybe.</p>

<p><strong>SRS:</strong>&nbsp;Oh, maybe.</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;I would just say that most days, dressing as well as I do is a crime and I get away with it!</p>

<p><strong>Everyone:</strong>&nbsp;Oh!</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know what I would do. Maybe a heist? But you know you&rsquo;re really trying to &mdash; is it because you really have to get away with something what crime would be the most enjoyable to commit?</p>

<p><strong>BM:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;I think a heist would be the one then, working with a really cool team of guys and everybody specializes on something there&rsquo;s all that coordination and everything else that would be.</p>

<p><strong>BC:</strong>&nbsp;Some Ocean&rsquo;s Eleven stuff.</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah exactly.</p>

<p><strong>BM:</strong>&nbsp;We already have the crew.</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;There you go.</p>

<p><strong>BM:</strong>&nbsp;I would do something like heist too but then take something that a lot of people really like and then just store it somewhere and never say anything about it. Like some piece of art, a really obscure piece of art that a bunch of people go to see it and I just take it and lock it away somewhere.</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;Nobody gets it.</p>

<p><strong>SRS:</strong>&nbsp;Alright.</p>

<h3><strong>If You Could Live Forever, How Would You Spend Eternity? What Skills Would You Learn First?</strong></h3>

<p><strong>SRS:</strong>&nbsp;I think social skills and being able to kind of surround you with great people. Because if you are in it for the long ride, it can get pretty boring if you&rsquo;re the only one and all the others kind of disappear, you have to learn how to make new friends otherwise you&rsquo;ll get lonely.</p>

<p><strong>BM:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah.</p>

<p><a href="https://theartofcharm.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><img alt="The Art of Charm" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/The-Art-of-Charm-1030x472.png" style="height:472px; width:1030px" /></a></p>

<p><a href="https://theartofcharm.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">The Art of Charm</a></p>

<p><strong>BC:</strong>&nbsp;There&rsquo;s a great event I heard of called&nbsp;<a href="https://theartofcharm.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">The Art of Charm</a>, that talks a lot about social skills.</p>

<p><strong>Everyone:</strong>&nbsp;(Laughing)</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, they can teach them to you.</p>

<p><strong>SRS</strong>: I should sign up for that!</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s an awesome place!</p>

<p><strong>BC:</strong>&nbsp;Sponsored by the Art of Charm!</p>

<p><strong>SRS:</strong>&nbsp;We are at the Charm headquarters in LA!</p>

<p><strong>BM:</strong>&nbsp;I think I would probably pick a few specific skills and just be like, &ldquo;Next 50 years, classical piano. 50 years after that like parkour!&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;So it&rsquo;s just like Groundhog Day style.</p>

<p><strong>BM:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah like Groundhog Day, exactly.</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;Or like the Brother&rsquo;s Bloom, with the girl where she basically collect hobbies because &mdash; have you guys not seen that?</p>

<p><strong>Everyone:</strong>&nbsp;No.</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;Oh man, it&rsquo;s a good one. But anyway&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>BM:</strong>&nbsp;Burn Notice then Brother Bloom.</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;No more Burn Notice.</p>

<h3>If You Could Take Three Items To A Deserted Island, What Would They Be?</h3>

<p><strong>BM:</strong>&nbsp;We go with Barron on this one.</p>

<p><strong>BC:</strong>&nbsp;Geez, these are hard questions.</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah.</p>

<p><strong>SRS:</strong>&nbsp;Is this like physical items, you would say?</p>

<p><strong>BM:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah.</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;You can&rsquo;t have a good attitude.</p>

<p><strong>Everyone:</strong>&nbsp;(Laughing)</p>

<p><strong>SRS:</strong>&nbsp;How about internet?</p>

<p><strong>BC:</strong>&nbsp;Like kindle?</p>

<p><strong>BM:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah I guess you could take Kindle but then you would run out of batteries.</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;Okay, let&rsquo;s clarify further. Are you trying to get off the desert island or this is where you are now existing?</p>

<p><strong>BM:</strong>&nbsp;I guess that&rsquo;s up to you. I mean, you could take a row boat or something?</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;Right? Because I think that&rsquo;s kind of an easy answer like, I would take a speed boat and a years worth of food and a GPS system. It&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m out of there.</p>

<p><strong>BM:</strong>&nbsp;Satellite phone.</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;Right! What if it&rsquo;s like you have to full-on survive style and you don&rsquo;t get all the amenities and I want that. I don&rsquo;t know what else.</p>

<p><strong>SRS:</strong>&nbsp;I know it&rsquo;s not a thing but I&rsquo;ll bring my wife because I want someone there because being on your own I think will be the hardest part.</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah definitely.</p>

<p><strong>BM:</strong>&nbsp;Hey, this man got the right answers. I probably would bring my Thursday&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shoes-boots-guide/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Shoes &amp; Boots Guide">boots</a>&nbsp;because I don&rsquo;t leave home without it.</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;Oh my gosh!</p>

<p><strong>Everyone:</strong>&nbsp;(Laughing)</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah like the original Boy scout handbook or something where you&rsquo;ve got all the skills right there where you can draw off of.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.orderofman.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><img alt="Ryan Michler of the Order of Man" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Ryan-Michler-of-the-Order-of-Man-1030x734.png" style="height:734px; width:1030px" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.orderofman.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Ryan Michler of the Order of Man</a></p>

<p><strong>SRS:</strong>&nbsp;Like survivalist skills. Someone like Ryan Michler will probably be the best.</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;Definitely.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.orderofman.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Orderofman.com</a></p>

<p><strong>BM:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah.</p>

<p><strong>SRS:</strong>&nbsp;Wait. Another question here.</p>

<h3><strong>If You Could Be An Animal, What Would It Be and Why?</strong></h3>

<p><strong>BM:</strong>&nbsp;I would definitely be some sort of bird. Probably a bird of prey because &mdash; flight. You have the gift of flight.</p>

<p><strong>SRS:</strong>&nbsp;That&rsquo;s really awesome. Good eyesight.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.themodestman.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title=""><img alt="Brock McGoff of Modest Man" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Brock2-copy-773x1030.jpg" style="height:1030px; width:773px" /></a></p>

<p>Brock McGoff of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.themodestman.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Modest Man</a>&nbsp;on choosing an animal &ndash; I would definitely be some sort of bird. You have the gift of flight</p>

<p><strong>BM:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah like a falcon or something. The only problem is then you got to catch your own food which kind of sucks but I think it would be worth it to fly.</p>

<p><strong>BC:</strong>&nbsp;Some sort of like apex predator just so you survive the longest.</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, but it would have to be something &mdash; a dolphin is a good one because being a wolf would suck or being a lion would suck because basically as soon as you cease to be functional within a pack, you&rsquo;re out. So you would want something that&rsquo;s a little less cutthroat and a little bit more social and cohesive. But dolphins are like well what man wants to be, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to be a dolphin!&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>BM:</strong>&nbsp;Anyone wants to talk about that?</p>

<p><strong>Everyone:</strong>&nbsp;(Laughing)</p>

<p><strong>SRS:</strong>&nbsp;They&rsquo;re smart animals!</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;They&rsquo;re super smart!</p>

<p><strong>SRS:</strong>&nbsp;They&rsquo;re smart and they have the social components.</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;Killer whale. There you go.</p>

<p><strong>BC:</strong>&nbsp;Alright</p>

<p><strong>SRS:</strong>&nbsp;Moby Dick.</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah Moby Dick.</p>

<p><strong>BM:</strong>&nbsp;Do you have one?</p>

<p><strong>SRS:</strong>&nbsp;I like the fox and the sense, you know. He&rsquo;s kind of sneaky and smart but I don&rsquo;t like the loneliness aspect of the fox.</p>

<p><strong>BM:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah.</p>

<p><strong>SRS:</strong>&nbsp;That&rsquo;s hard. Maybe like a big brown bear.</p>

<p><strong>BM:</strong>&nbsp;Ok yeah. They don&rsquo;t have any predators.</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;This is true.</p>

<h3><strong>If You Could Have One Superpower Or Be One Superhero, Who Or What Would It Be?</strong></h3>

<p><strong>SRS:</strong>&nbsp;So it wouldn&rsquo;t be Batman because he doesn&rsquo;t have any superpowers really. So I wouldn&rsquo;t be Hulk because I don&rsquo;t like that necessarily.</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;You&rsquo;re not angry all the time?</p>

<p><strong>SRS:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah. Maybe superman.</p>

<p><strong>BM:</strong>&nbsp;Because he&rsquo;s got it all!</p>

<p><strong>SRS:</strong>&nbsp;Exactly. Why pick?</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;I was not huge in comics but Spiderman was always my favorite growing up and that&rsquo;s a good enough set of powers that you can do some real damage but at the same time it&rsquo;s not so far gone that you can&rsquo;t lead a normal life and get close to people and do all those other things too. Being a Hulk would suck!</p>

<p><strong>BM:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah it would be inconvenient.</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;Honestly, dealing with the immortality of being a Superman or somebody else would kind of suck too because you would just watch your family and your friends and your kids and everybody else keep passing on without you. Yeah, I would be Spiderman</p>

<p><strong>SRS:</strong>&nbsp;Barron?</p>

<p><strong>BC:</strong>&nbsp;I think for an individual superpower, I would probably say teleportation just to be able to go somewhere instantly.</p>

<p><strong>SRS:</strong>&nbsp;That is awesome.</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;Imagine if you&rsquo;re just home right now. (Snaps fingers) That would be pretty great.</p>

<p><strong>BC:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah instead of 6 hours of flying. It would be awesome.</p>

<p><strong>SRS:</strong>&nbsp;As a kid, I always thought it would be cool to kind of go to the future to see what&rsquo;s happening. Like now I&rsquo;m more like I would like to know what it was like in the 13th century. How is it for you guys? More like back to the future?</p>

<p><strong>BM:</strong>&nbsp;That&rsquo;s funny because the next question was..</p>

<h3>If You Could Travel Would You Go To The Past Or The Future?</h3>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;Past.</p>

<p><strong>BM:</strong>&nbsp;I&rsquo;d go to the future. I just want to see.</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;That&rsquo;s only like 10 years from now and then it&rsquo;s over.</p>

<p><strong>BM:</strong>&nbsp;But imagine, I wouldn&rsquo;t go crazy like thousands of years in the future. I would go to 100 years from now. When I was a kid I really thought we would have a hover board by now.</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;So would you steal the Sports Almanac and come back?</p>

<p><strong>BM:</strong>&nbsp;Obviously.</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;This could be wasted on you young viewers, but that&rsquo;s a funny joke.</p>

<p><strong>SRS:</strong>&nbsp;If you go to the past you could just change things and then change the outcome of the future. A lot of people say &ldquo;Hey, you know what? Go back and put like a drug in Hitler&rsquo;s birth town&rsquo;s bar so you know he wouldn&rsquo;t, you know. But then maybe someone else will come up and it could be worse. We just don&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah there&rsquo;s a whole historical theory about that like whether it&rsquo;s people who drive events or it&rsquo;s the events that kind of create the need for this person to fill the vacuum if it weren&rsquo;t Hitler it would have been somebody else doing the exact same thing.</p>

<h3><strong>Which Fad Do You Wish Would Come Back?</strong></h3>

<p><strong>BC:</strong>&nbsp;Slap braceletes!</p>

<p><strong>SRS:</strong>&nbsp;Really?</p>

<p><strong>BC:</strong>&nbsp;You had one of those?</p>

<p><strong>SRS:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah! A whole collection.</p>

<p><strong>Everyone:</strong>&nbsp;(Laughing)</p>

<p><strong>SRS:</strong>&nbsp;My sister had them. I&rsquo;d like to have basically&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/dinner-party-ideas-how-to-host/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Rules of Civility – Dinner Party Ideas &amp; How To">dinner parties</a>&nbsp;come back. I think it&rsquo;s just an art that in our generation a lot of people have just not grown up with it. And so, they&rsquo;re like, &ldquo;Hey, let&rsquo;s meet at the bar.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s fun being in your own home and cooking a meal just connects you more and you can have all your favorite&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/liqueur-guide/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="The Liqueur Guide">liqueur</a>&nbsp;and your favorite drink.</p>

<p><strong>BC:</strong>&nbsp;Right.</p>

<p><strong>SRS:</strong>&nbsp;I think that&rsquo;s the best and I would wish that more people would be kind of into that.</p>

<p><img alt="The Power Rangers remake" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/The-Power-Rangers-remake-1030x598.png" style="height:598px; width:1030px" /></p>

<p>The Power Rangers remake</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;I miss the kind of innocent hokiness of media from the 80s and the 90s. Like not everything was dark and desaturated and gritty and everything had to be super, like the Power Rangers remake. That&rsquo;s not the Power Rangers. It&rsquo;s not this raw, it&rsquo;s stupid and fun and campy and obviously, that&rsquo;s like nostalgia for my time as a kid, but when things were a little bit more innocent.</p>

<p><strong>BM:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;I guess that&rsquo;s not a fad.</p>

<p><strong>BM:</strong>&nbsp;You know I think it&rsquo;s like a fad but more like a toy. Remember pogs?</p>

<p><strong>Everyone:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah!</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;A killer slammer collection.</p>

<p><strong>BM:</strong>&nbsp;I invested a decent amount of time and money in that slammer collection. I remember going to TJ Maxx or something and seeing buckets of pogs and they&rsquo;re like a penny each and I was like, &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s my investment.&rdquo; Yeah, that&rsquo;s a tough one.</p>

<p><strong>SRS:</strong>&nbsp;Upper Deck Trading cards! The same style right?</p>

<p><strong>BM:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah exactly. The trading cards I remember I collected X-men cards. I have like the entire series deck. They kind of like have seasons, like series 2 of X-men I remember, I was convinced that one day that would be worth a lot of money. I don&rsquo;t think it is.</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;Probably not.</p>

<h3><strong>Who Is Your Personal Hero And Why?</strong></h3>

<p>(There was a long 30-second pause)</p>

<p><strong>BM:</strong>&nbsp;It can be someone you actually know or someone you don&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;Well I think that it&rsquo;s kind of interesting that we all hesitated with this one because hero-worship used to be something that was so normal. And I think for our generation, it&rsquo;s not something that we deal with as much because it&rsquo;s not necessarily one particular person who exemplifies all the things you want to be and all the things you want to be a part of. We more look up to and idealize ideals or accomplishments or other things as opposed to it being one individual person. I&rsquo;m stalling. I mean I agree with all that but I&rsquo;m stalling.</p>

<p><strong>SRS:</strong>&nbsp;You guys?</p>

<p><strong>BC:</strong>&nbsp;I agree with that. It&rsquo;s hard to say and can&rsquo;t really think of one specific person. When I think of qualities, like people I&rsquo;ve looked up to in the past, it&rsquo;s not one specific person that embodies everything. You just kind of fall from where you want to learn from.</p>

<p><strong>SRS:</strong>&nbsp;I&rsquo;m not a worshipper. When I see celebrities I don&rsquo;t say hi. I just leave them in peace. Once I do have someone to look up to, someone who is more like elite and uses his status not just to have riches in life but try to kind of create a movement of some sort. I think that&rsquo;s admirable. Being who you are and trying to make a change, building a foundation. I think that&rsquo;s pretty cool because you could say, &ldquo;Hey, you know I kind of had a good life and enjoyed.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;So do you like that whole concept in general or do you like it only if you&rsquo;re in favor of the movement that the person is trying to get started.</p>

<p><strong>SRS:</strong>&nbsp;No. I mean in general I think it&rsquo;s just a good cause.</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s just as good as liking Trump. Boom!</p>

<p><strong>Everyone:</strong>&nbsp;(Laughing)</p>

<p><strong>BM:</strong>&nbsp;He worked it in.</p>

<h3>If You Could Fight Anyone In History, Who Would It Be?</h3>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;Is it to the death?</p>

<p><strong>BM:</strong>&nbsp;Ah no. Let&rsquo;s say like MMA style like knock down-knock out.</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;Okay. George Washington, because if I go back to the hero question he&rsquo;s one who would be really close, like really high up there. I know there is no way I would win that fight but just the ability to be in proximity and to test yourself against something that you hold against such a high standard, I think that would be awesome.</p>

<p><strong>BM:</strong>&nbsp;Do you think he would kick your ass?</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;Absolutely he would! I don&rsquo;t live that kind of life. I&rsquo;m a little limp wristed pansy compared to Washington in the way that he had to live. Absolutely he would destroy me.</p>

<p><strong>BM:</strong>&nbsp;I would fight my brother just one more time.</p>

<p><strong>Everyone:</strong>&nbsp;(Laughing)</p>

<p><strong>BM:</strong>&nbsp;Because I&rsquo;m pretty sure I can take him now.</p>

<p><strong>SRS:</strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;Now I know all that Brazilian Jiu jitsu dude. Watch out!&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>BM:</strong>&nbsp;One more. We still have time, maybe it won&rsquo;t happen.</p>

<p><strong>BC:</strong>&nbsp;Maybe like the kid who kicked my stomach in 4th grade.</p>

<p><strong>BM:</strong>&nbsp;Okay</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;He probably doesn&rsquo;t remember it at all.</p>

<p><strong>BC:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah.</p>

<p><strong>SRS:</strong>&nbsp;Revenge.</p>

<p><strong>BM:</strong>&nbsp;That circle. How about you? Who would you fight?</p>

<p><strong>SRS:</strong>&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m not a big enough fighter.</p>

<p><strong>BC:</strong>&nbsp;Your a lover.</p>

<p><strong>SRS:</strong>&nbsp;I&rsquo;m competitive but I&rsquo;m more like the brains guy less like you know, I never felt like punching you or stuff.</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;But those are not mutually exclusive.</p>

<p><strong>SRS:</strong>&nbsp;That is true.</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;Look at the Greeks, the Romans and they very much celebrated the warrior-philosopher and the idea that you can be physically capable and dominant and see violence as something that can be used morally or immorally, and you can also be intelligent and you can use your wit and intelligence both morally and immorally. It&rsquo;s not one or the other but that they can often function synergistically with each other.</p>

<p><strong>SRS:</strong>&nbsp;Maybe someone like Bruce Lee with Kung fu!</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah!</p>

<p><strong>SRS:</strong>&nbsp;When I was a kid I was always impressed by Shaolin monks and how they could have their mind dominate their body in the sense that they could just put a pot of boiling water in their skin and just control that. So I&rsquo;d lose right away but I&rsquo;ll be in awe about it.</p>

<p><strong>BM:</strong>&nbsp;Plus you can say you fought Bruce Lee.</p>

<p><strong>SRS:</strong>&nbsp;Exactly.</p>

<p>Brock from the Modest Man &amp; Barron Cuadro from effortlessgent</p>

<h3><strong>Would You Rather Explore Another Planet Or The Deepest Parts Of The Ocean?</strong></h3>

<p><strong>BC:</strong>&nbsp;I&rsquo;m going to go with space travel on that one. Because can you imagine what&rsquo;s down there? You have no idea.</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah we don&rsquo;t have any more idea what&rsquo;s in space.</p>

<p><strong>BC:</strong>&nbsp;Right, I guess so but I was thinking like I&rsquo;ve read a cool documentary or single documentaries of stuff that&rsquo;s like 20,000 feet below the sea and there&rsquo;s nasty shit down there.</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;Right.</p>

<p><strong>BC:</strong>&nbsp;But like in space you just don&rsquo;t know so you&rsquo;re kind of open, hopeful.</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;What I think part of it too is that it&rsquo;s less scary if it&rsquo;s out there versus just like right down there.</p>

<p><strong>BC:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah. There&rsquo;s no concept too of what out there is.</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;Exactly.</p>

<p><strong>SRS:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, space definitely.</p>

<p><strong>BM:</strong>&nbsp;So would you go if somehow you were selected, you could bring your family or the people closest to you and you were selected to go to Mars or somewhere else to like start colonizing, but you couldn&rsquo;t come back. Would you go?</p>

<p><strong>SRS:</strong>&nbsp;No.</p>

<p><strong>TG:</strong>&nbsp;Probably not.</p>

<p><strong>BC:</strong>&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t think so. I think there&rsquo;s a team already being put together or applicants already in the works for people who&rsquo;re the first people going to Mars, which is just crazy right?</p>

<p><strong>SRS:</strong>&nbsp;You could take risks and stuff but at the same time like I enjoy life! I&rsquo;m not like, &ldquo;Hey, this so shitty here I need to kind of get out. I need to leave and go to US because I&rsquo;m like religiously..&rdquo; like no, I&rsquo;m happy!</p>',

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Perhaps no other figure in the history of American cinema did as much to define the spirit of the musical as did Fred Astaire. He is remembered primarily as a dancer&ndash;and rightly so, as his supremely tasteful blend of tap and ballroom styles, with a dash of ballet, meant that he is often seen as America&rsquo;s most consummate film dancer. His only real rival for that title is a contemporary of his, Gene Kelly. He was also a distinctive singer, and he introduced many of the songs now part of the pantheon known collectively as&nbsp;<a href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=12980&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGreat-American-Songbook-Composers-Standards%2Fdp%2F1423419545" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="">The Great American Songbook</a>. His acting style showcased a blend of optimistic insouciance that was the ideal of American cinema at the time. But in addition to all this (and our primary focus here): his impeccable style.</p>

<h2>Fred Astaire&rsquo;s Early Years</h2>

<p>He was born Frederick Emanuel Austerlitz on May 10th, 1899 in Omaha, Nebraska. When Fred&rsquo;s older sister, Adele, began to show a natural talent for dancing, both of the children began pursuing the art. Although Fred refused to take dance lessons at first, he was easily able to mimic his sister&rsquo;s movements, showing his natural talent. Also, he took up piano, accordion, and clarinet, showing that he was equally adept as a musician.</p>

<p>The family moved to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/top-sartorial-destinations/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">New York</a>&nbsp;in 1905, and both of the children would start receiving formal training at this point. Also around this time, the family name was changed from Austerlitz to the more elegant Astaire. By the age of 14, Fred had taken on the musical responsibilities for his and Adele&rsquo;s act, and at the age of 16 he first met composer, George Gershwin, launching a friendship and collaboration that would profoundly impact American popular culture. The Astaires first hit Broadway in 1917, and they would continue to perform on Broadway and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/vintage-elegant-london/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">London</a>&nbsp;stages throughout the 1920s. Even at this point, Fred&rsquo;s tap dancing was recognized as being among the best.</p>

<p>In 1930, Robert Benchley wrote, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that I will plunge the nation into war by stating that Fred is the greatest tap dancer in the world.&rdquo; When his sister Adele married Lord Charles Cavendish in 1932, Fred continued on the stage as a solo act, and then hit Hollywood in 1933. Despite a poor screen test at&nbsp;<a href="http://rko.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">RKO Radio Pictures</a>, which (according to Fred) read, &ldquo;<em>can&rsquo;t act, slightly bald, also dances</em>,&rdquo; producer David O. Selznick took a chance on him, saying, &ldquo;I am uncertain about the man, but I feel, in spite of his enormous ears and bad chin line, that his charm is so tremendous that it comes through even in this wretched test.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Fred Astaire&rsquo;s Movies</h2>

<p>Fred made his film debut in the musical&nbsp;<em>Dancing Lady</em>, playing opposite Joan Crawford, and was then paired with Ginger Rogers for a sequence in the film&nbsp;<em>Flying Down to Rio</em>.&nbsp;<a href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=12980&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FTCM-Greatest-Classic-Film-Collection%2Fdp%2FB00406UJZG%2Fref%3Dsr_1_9%3Fkeywords%3Dfred%2Bastaire%26qid%3D1574388966%26s%3Dmovies-tv%26sr%3D1-9" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="">Astaire and Rogers</a>&nbsp;would make nine films together at RKO, including&nbsp;<em>Top Hat</em>,&nbsp;<em>Follow the Fleet</em>,&nbsp;<em>Swing Time</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Shall We Dance</em>. Six out of these nine RKO musicals became the biggest money-makers for the studio, and they propelled Fred and Ginger to superstardom. Leaving RKO in 1939 to freelance in film (which was relatively rare at the time), Astaire would go on to partner with other dancers such as Eleanor Powell and Rita Hayworth, and he also made two memorable films with Bing Crosby.</p>

<p>Throughout the 1950s and &rsquo;60s, Astaire would go on to headline a few other musical films, as well as produce a number of television specials. His final musical film was 1968&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em><a href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=12980&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FFinians-Rainbow-Fred-Astaire%2Fdp%2FB01ESNHF84%2Fref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fcrid%3D7XKYSCWF9I9E%26keywords%3Dfinians%2Brainbow%2Bdvd%26qid%3D1574391222%26s%3Dmovies-tv%26sprefix%3Dfinian%252Cmovies-tv-intl-ship%252C386%26sr%3D1-1" rel="nofollow" target="" title="">Finian&rsquo;s Rainbow</a></em>, and he had a few more dramatic roles in the 1970s. 1981&rsquo;s&nbsp;<em><a href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=12980&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGhost-Story-Blu-ray-Fred-Astaire%2Fdp%2FB0145UQSSI%2Fref%3Dsr_1_3%3Fcrid%3DF8J6GX0PCA6C%26keywords%3Dghost%2Bstory%26qid%3D1574391281%26s%3Dmovies-tv%26sprefix%3Dghost%2Bst%252Cmovies-tv-intl-ship%252C397%26sr%3D1-3" rel="nofollow" target="" title="">Ghost Story</a></em>&nbsp;was Astaire&rsquo;s final film. He died of pneumonia on June 22, 1987, at the age of 88. Even after his death, his legacy as a singer and a dancer lives on.</p>

<p>Astaire is credited with two innovations in the history of early film musicals: the first was leaving the camera largely stationary in long, unbroken shots, to show the full scope of a dance routine. The second was harnessing a film&rsquo;s musical numbers to actually serve the plot, rather than just being diversions. And although he possessed a somewhat light voice, Astaire was admired as a singer by such great American composers as Irving Berlin, George Gershwin, and Cole Porter. More popular songs in the so-called Great American Songbook were introduced on film by Astaire than any other popular singer at the time, including Bing Crosby or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/frank-sinatra-style-gentleman/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Frank Sinatra</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Fred-Astaire-in-White-Tie.jpg"><img alt="Fred Astaire in White Tie" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Fred-Astaire-in-White-Tie-836x1030.jpg" style="height:1030px; width:836px" /></a></p>

<h2>Astaire&rsquo;s Clothing &amp; Style</h2>

<p>One need look no further than the various characters Astaire played on film at the time to get an overall sense of his style. These characters notably broke with the standards of the time for what an ideal male leading character was to be. Rather than being wealthy, titled, or overly formal, Astaire&rsquo;s characters (and indeed he himself) embodied a more modern American male ideal: self-made, ambitious, self-taught, and tenacious.</p>

<p>As menswear historian G. Bruce Boyer writes in his book,&nbsp;<em><a href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=12980&amp;GR_URL=http%3A%2F%2Famzn.to%2F2d6OwXx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Fred Astaire Style</a></em>,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Astaire mixed his dance styles the way he mixed his dress styles: with a spontaneous exuberance in which the hard work was well hidden within the detail and subtlety. His blend of urban English shape with casual American style typifies American dress to this day. His characters showed a fresh approach to the romantic hero: vitality, urbanity, charm, and natural talent, all carried off in an effortless manner. Astaire was the democratic ideal: A classless aristocrat.</p>

<p>Essentially, Astaire&rsquo;s sartorial genius came from his ability to look simultaneously<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/the-formality-scale-how/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">&nbsp;formal and casual</a>, neat and yet pleasingly rumpled. He was intimately well-acquainted with the traditional rules of menswear, so he knew how to bend or break them in order to fit his own taste. He could wear suits in conservative shades without looking drab, more colorful combinations without looking gaudy, and of course, a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/suit-vs-tuxedo-part-i/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">tuxedo or a full-dress ensemble</a>&nbsp;without looking the least bit uncomfortable. So how, then, did he accomplish this? In order to answer that question, here&rsquo;s a more complete breakdown of Astaire&rsquo;s particular style choices.</p>

<h3>A Focus on Softness and Comfort</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/suit-jackets-sport-coats-and-blazers-whats-the-difference/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Jackets</a>&nbsp;had to be roomy enough not to be constricting but to still hold their shape. Trousers had to be cut on the full side, but not sloppy or billowy. From Astaire, &ldquo;A new aesthetic evolved, and so did the relationship between clothes and attitude, style and demeanor. During the Depression, this aesthetic became the mid-Atlantic model: a blend of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/savile-row-book-hasegawa/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Savile Row</a>&nbsp;with Princeton.&rdquo; In other words, Astaire was able to seamlessly combine the hallmarks of traditional&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/british-mens-classic-style/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">English tailoring</a>&nbsp;with a more contemporary American&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/the-preppy-style-primer/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">prep style</a>. Astaire had ample exposure to both of these traditions, as he had been a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/brooks-brothers-history/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Brooks Brothers</a>&nbsp;customer since his teens, and his travels while on stage in London had introduced him to Savile Row.</p>

<p>To follow this dual emphasis on form and function, Astaire chose supple weights of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/fabric-guide/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">fabric</a>&nbsp;to enhance the drape of his suits and in particular, he always made sure that his armholes were cut particularly high to maximize his movement, especially when dancing. This was particularly true of his full-dress ensembles, which were often made by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/anderson-sheppard-book-a-style-is-born-review/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Anderson &amp; Sheppard</a>. While many men assume that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/white-tie-guide/white-tie-dos-dont/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">white tie</a>&nbsp;must be inherently uncomfortable to wear, with its high starched collar and exacting cuts, Astaire definitely proved this assumption to be false.</p>

<h2>Suits</h2>

<p>Fortunately, we do not need to speculate on Astaire&rsquo;s opinions about specific different kinds of garments, because he gave these opinions to interviewer Richard Hubler in a 1957 piece for&nbsp;<em>Gentleman&rsquo;s Quarterly</em>.&nbsp;In terms of suits, he typically preferred traditional, staple hues, like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/the-navy-blue-spring-suit/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">navy blue</a>&nbsp;and charcoal&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-to-pair-shirts-ties-with-gray-suits/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">grays</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/brown-most-underrated-color/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">browns</a>. &ldquo;The only light color I like is light gray,&rdquo; he said. Meanwhile, his choices for combinations of a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/suit-jackets-sport-coats-and-blazers-whats-the-difference/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">blazer or sport coat</a>&nbsp;with odd trousers could often be a bit more bold, and incorporate&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-match-colors-patterns/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">patterns</a>. In either case, he did prefer that his jackets usually have deep side vents, often up to seven inches or so, in accordance with traditional British styling.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/4098402.webp"><img alt="Fred Astaire and Audrey Hepburn" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/4098402.webp" style="height:789px; width:582px" /></a></p>

<h2>Trousers</h2>

<p>His trousers were usually both&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/should-men-wear-pleated-pants/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">pleated</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/should-you-wear-cuffed-pants/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">cuffed</a>, although he did wear them shorter than many men of the time, with little or no break. He said, &ldquo;I do not want them slopping over onto my shoes.&rdquo; Another reason for a shorter&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/proper-pants-break/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">trouser break</a>&nbsp;was to draw more attention to his feet while dancing in films. He also accomplished this by wearing socks (and sometimes shoes) in contrasting colors to the trousers. While he did prefer a shorter hem, Astaire also preferred for his trousers to have a higher waistline. This made his legs look longer and more athletic, and made him&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-to-dress-taller-and-leaner/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">appear taller</a>&nbsp;overall, even though he was only about 5&rsquo;9&rdquo;.</p>

<h2>Shoes</h2>

<p>Of course, shoes were the workhorses of Astaire&rsquo;s wardrobe. He was often said to go through dozens of pairs while rehearsing for a show or a film, and in terms of his own private collection, he often preferred two-tone&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/spectator-two-tone-shoe-guide/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">spectator shoes</a>, or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/oxford-shoes-guide/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">oxfords</a>&nbsp;in either white buckskin or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-to-wear-brown-shoes-boots-men/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">brown</a>&nbsp;suede.</p>

<h2>Shirts</h2>

<p>Astaire purchased just as many off-the-rack&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/must-have-dress-shirts/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">shirts</a>&nbsp;as he had&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/custom-made-hand-made-bench/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">custom made</a>. In his time, the style was for shirts to fit more generously in the chest and sleeves than they do today, so a slightly looser fit that one would typically get off-the-rack would not be seen as sloppy. Still, his shirts did fit him well for his size. He would occasionally wear patterned shirts, in something like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/stripes-menswear-different-types/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">stripes</a>, but he was most partial to solids in pastel colors like blue,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-wear-yellow-menswear/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">yellow</a>, and a personal favorite of his,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-wear-pink-menswear/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">pink</a>. Solid pastel shirts, by the way, are a maximally versatile option for pairing with all different manners of ties and jackets, as well as accessories.</p>

<p>Overall, he preferred button-cuff shirts to ones with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wearing-french-cuffs-on-shirts/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">French cuffs</a>, and would typically wear&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-to-combine-cuff-links/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">cufflinks</a>&nbsp;only with formal dress&ndash;wherein they, as well as the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/accessories/cufflinks" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">shirt studs</a>, would often contain precious gems. He disliked tab collars, often preferring&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shirt-collar-styles-a-complete-guide/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">button-down collars or spread collars</a>&nbsp;strengthened with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shirt-stays-collar-guide/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">collar stays</a>. When he did choose to wear a traditional point collar, he would often accentuate it by wearing a collar pin, clip, or bar.</p>

<h2>Ties &amp; Bow Ties</h2>

<p>In terms of ties, he preferred tying a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/windsor-knot-how-to-tie/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Windsor knot</a>, and often opted for fuller, wider ties. He explained in that 1957 interview that he avoided narrower ties because, &ldquo;I am narrow enough myself, too narrow.&rdquo; While he was a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/accessories/bow-ties" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">bow tie</a>&nbsp;wearer in his younger years, Astaire later settled into wearing primarily long&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/accessories/ties" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">neckties</a>, and then in his later years, wearing neckerchiefs and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/accessories/ascots" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">ascots</a>. Another use of neckwear for Astaire was one that would become a personal hallmark for him: using old ties or handkerchiefs as belts. This came from his dancing days, when his weight would fluctuate so rapidly that belts would be impractical at keeping up his trousers.</p>

<h2>Other Accessories</h2>

<p>Also a fan of colorful&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/accessories/pocket-square-handkerchief" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">pocket squares</a>, Astaire would usually wear them in more&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/tuxedo-black-tie-guide/basics-101/how-fold-pocket-square/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">casual folds</a>, rather than something highly structured. Other than collar pins, tie bars, and occasionally a ring, Astaire did also like to accessorize with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/accessories/boutonnieres" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">boutonnieres</a>, particularly carnations. In&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/men-hats-anatomy-vocabulary/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">hats</a>, he liked models with low crowns and fairly narrow brims, usually of about 2 1/8 inches. According to him, &ldquo;an eighth of an inch can make a lot of difference in a brim.&rdquo; And while he obviously wore top hats with his full-dress and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/morning-dress-dress-code/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">morning-dress ensembles</a>, his everyday choices were felt&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/fedora-hat-guide/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">fedoras</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/straw-boater-hat-guide/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">straw boaters</a>, often accented with colorful grosgrain hatbands.</p>

<h2>The Fred Astaire Attitude</h2>

<p>With all of this said, how can one effectively emulate Fred Astaire&rsquo;s style? The easiest way to do it, of course, would be to just directly follow all of the points we&rsquo;ve laid out here. Equally important to the garments themselves, however, is the attitude with which they are worn. As we&rsquo;ve already said, while Astaire did not shy away from incorporating&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/pattern-matching-good-taste-test/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">patterns</a>&nbsp;into his shirts or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/accessories" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">accessories</a>, he was able to assemble outfits with what can honestly be called an artist&rsquo;s eye. His combinations were always harmonious, and while they could be playful or even bright, they were never ostentatious or over-the-top.</p>

<p>While he was always smartly attired, Astaire took pleasure in his wardrobe and fundamentally dressed for himself. As he was quoted in the aforementioned 1957 interview:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I know that once in a while I have been on lists of best-dressed men, but it always comes as a surprise to me. I never think of myself as spic-and-span or all duded out, just as someone who wants to be comfortable and satisfy his own taste.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As for wearing white tie like Astaire, remember that the fit must be immaculate, ensuring ease of movement. Even so, as he admitted in his autobiography,&nbsp;<em><a href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=12980&amp;GR_URL=http%3A%2F%2Famzn.to%2F2d6O7EK" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Steps in Time</a></em>, &ldquo;At the risk of disillusionment, I must admit that I do not like top hats, white ties, and tails.&rdquo;&nbsp;If you are looking for print resources to study up on Fred Astaire&rsquo;s style, we would again recommend G. Bruce Boyer&rsquo;s book,&nbsp;<em><a href="http://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=12980&amp;GR_URL=http%3A%2F%2Famzn.to%2F2d6OwXx" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="">Fred Astaire Style</a></em>, as well as Astaire&rsquo;s own autobiography.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Fred Astaire created a unique blend of functionality and flair. Due to his classic-first-quirky-second leaning, his style has truly stood the test of time. Again quoting from Boyer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He could wear the uniform of the upper class when the need called for it, but it&rsquo;s ironic that the man some associated with the top hat and tails is really the one who popularized the sports jacket and soft lounge suit. Astaire wore white ties and tails as though they were pajamas, and a tuxedo as though it were a part of his everyday routine..It was not supposed to look perfect, it was supposed to look natural. It worked then, and it works now. It&rsquo;s what genius and style are all about.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>What is a Signet Ring?</h2>

<p>Have you ever wondered why some men wear engraved rings on their ring or pinky finger? It is a signet ring. Signet rings have been a practical part of men&rsquo;s fashion for thousands of years. For wealthy and important men, a signet ring was a powerful tool akin to a signature. A signet ring is set apart from other rings based on an engraved or raised symbol, series of words or letters, or image on the top half of the ring that was representative of its wearer in some way. It could have been a name, initials, job title, rank, organization or family crest.</p>

<p>Though no longer necessary to seal correspondence, it was once an essential part of society and culture and played a significant role in history. We&rsquo;ll explore the rich history of the signet ring, how to wear it, and where and how to buy one. Considered the &ldquo;gentleman&rsquo;s ring&rdquo;, we hope you enjoy this primer.</p>

<h2>The History of Signet Rings</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Joachim-von-Anhalt-with-signet-ring-on-index-finger-of-left-hand.jpg"><img alt="Joachim von Anhalt with signet ring on index finger of left hand" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Joachim-von-Anhalt-with-signet-ring-on-index-finger-of-left-hand-725x1030.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>Nobility were the original wearers of signet rings, such as Prince Joachim von Anhalt, painted in 1532 wearing a signet ring on the index finger of his left hand that shows the Anhalt coat of arms</p>

<p>Historically, signet rings played a significant role in business and politics. Used as a seal, a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/gentleman-what-it-means-today/" rel="noopener" title="What It Means To Be A Gentleman Today">gentleman</a>&nbsp;would use his ring featuring his unique family crest, emblem or monogram to stamp important documents. By dipping the ring into hot wax or soft clay, the ring left a distinct seal that was considered, at the time, to be more official than that of a signature.</p>

<p>Used on a global scale by the world&rsquo;s leaders and monumental men, the ring was seen as a way to prove authenticity. They are often referred to as seal rings today.</p>

<p><img alt="The signet ring is used as a seal for wax" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Signet-ring-used-as-a-seal-1030x1030.jpg" /></p>

<p>The signet ring is used as a seal for wax</p>

<p>The ring itself had markings on it that identified the specific person or the family of the person wearing it. Sometimes this was a family crest or a coat of arms, but other times it was nothing more than an icon or a monogram that was associated with a family.</p>

<p>Mesopotamian Signet Ring</p>

<p>Signet rings have been used since as far back as 3500 BC when the people of Mesopotamia began using them as a method of authenticity. Initially, a seal as opposed to a ring, it was a cylindrical device that was rolled across wet clay leaving a distinct impression in the clay. Used to seal a variety of envelopes, jars, and packages, they also functioned in the same way as corporate seals do today, and of course, this is where the corporate seal comes from.</p>

<p>In Ancient Egypt, pharaohs, religious leaders, and nobles would wear the rings made of stone or pottery called faience. The rings were flat on the outside and ornate with decorations and symbols used to denote its owner.</p>

<p>In fact, the Old Testament even mentions signet rings in the story of Daniel in the lion&rsquo;s den&hellip;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel. (Daniel 6:17)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the Early Minoan age, the rings were formed out of soft stones and ivory. Come the Middle Minoan age they were made of harder stone, and by the Late Bronze age, they had become the signet rings we would recognize today. During the Hellenistic period (323 BC &ndash; 31 AD), they were considered an art form in addition to being used for a purpose. Around the same time. King Mithridates VI of Pontus was an avid collector of signet rings.</p>

<p>By medieval times, most members of the nobility wore a signet ring and used it to sign and seal their letters of nobility or other important papers. The signet ring was now widely considered the only authentic way to sign without concern of forgery or tampering.</p>

<p>By the fourteenth century and under the stronghold or King Edward II, it was said that all official documents must bear the seal of the king&rsquo;s signet ring.</p>

<p>Despite some people having signet rings that were handed down, most of them are quite modern. For many centuries, the ring would be destroyed when the owner passed, and because they were worn by noblemen, they weren&rsquo;t copied and were considered very valuable, hence their name &ldquo;signet&rdquo; which is translated to mean &ldquo;a small seal employed for formal or official purpose&rdquo;.</p>

<p>By the middle ages and well into the nineteenth century, most men wore these rings with some form of a badge on the flat side. With the King&rsquo;s signet being the most prized signet in the world, all men viewed their rings as important artifacts. It was a mark of elitism, class and that you were a member of the superior society of men if you had a true signet ring.</p>

<p>Despite legal documents being around, the art of handwriting was not and that&rsquo;s one reason why the signet ring was so vital and important to members of society who would be responsible for signing such documents. Since the ring was so powerful, it was sometimes destroyed when the man died and often a ceremony or ritual was performed.</p>

<p>The first signet rings were made with raised decoration and lettering whereas, following the development of sealing wax, it was actually made with a depressed design.</p>

<p>The image would be left when the ring was pressed into it, therefore, had to be resilient to wear and damage. Often the rings would be made of gold or silver with the design cast, rather than carved into the flat end of the ring.</p>

<p>Although large in size, they were also intended as a symbol of class and wealth. Due to the considerable cost, many families had a single ring that was handed down from father to son &ndash; only the very wealthy or important members of society had rings exclusive to them. This included the king, religious leaders, doctors of medicine, barristers and solicitors as well as other noblemen.</p>

<p>With the popularity of the rings increasing, many families would keep these heavy and large rings in family jewel boxes as they became more ornate and decorated over the years. Many times men would opt not to wear them on their finger and instead mounted them on chains or the fob of their pocket watch.</p>

<p>The most common rings were initials and monograms with the more titled men wearing rings decorated with their official coat of arms or family crest. Some had simple symbols and others had one letter or a distinct pattern.</p>

<p>This French 19th-century signet ring from the time of Napoleon III features a carved carnelian intaglio image of a warrior</p>

<p>As the nineteenth century approached, men began to engrave precious stones such as rubies, bloodstone and other semi-precious gems fastened to their ring. Made of equally important metals such as gold and silver, the solid metal varieties traditionally had raised emblems with a cable border.</p>

<p>Young FDR with stacked wedding band and signet ring</p>

<p>FDR came from a well-to-do American family, and such families often copied the European tradition of wearing signet rings. FDR wore his in the British style, stacked over his wedding ring on his pinky finger after he inherited it from his father. His signet ring was admired by Winston Churchill.</p>

<h2>The Signet Ring Today</h2>

<p>Today the signet ring doesn&rsquo;t hold much meaning in society anymore. It&rsquo;s more of a fashion statement or family heirloom handed down from one generation to the next. The Royal family in England and other aristocratic families in Europe represent a few types of people you might expect to see wearing an authentic, inherited signet ring.</p>

<p><img alt="Prince+Charles+Prince+Wales+Supports+WWF+Green+m29H2QEmEnnx" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/PrinceCharlesPrinceWalesSupportsWWFGreenm29H2QEmEnnx.jpg" /></p>

<p>Prince Charles has developed a characteristic look over the years that includes double-breasted peaked lapel suits and his Prince of Wales signet ring</p>

<p>There are still those who commission a ring maker to create a family signet ring, but most men who own the traditional signet rings inherited them from their ancestors and will eventually hand it down to the next generation. Therefore, the ring isn&rsquo;t a true mark of them as an individual, but of someone else in the line.</p>

<p>An engraved signet ring worn on the ring finger</p>

<p>Many world leaders opted to wear these rings on a daily basis whereas others stowed them safely away. Today, variations of signet rings still occur with many Freemasons wearing a marked ring identifying themselves to others. Many other clubs and organizations offer seal rings as well.</p>

<p>In most cases today it&rsquo;s a matter of personal style when a man wears a signet ring.</p>

<p>Some clubs, corporations, and families continue to give seal rings as gifts upon a certain length of service, a graduation or a commendation. Many military men wear signet rings that reflect their rank as a status symbol whereas others wear symbolic rings to showcase the branch they served with.</p>

<h2>No Family Crest? No Problem!</h2>

<p>If you like the design or the concept of a signet ring but your family doesn&rsquo;t have a coat of arms, should you get one? Legally, the answer is clear. Anyone can go out and create a ring with their own coat of arms and some people who are traditionalists may argue that it is more the sign of an impostor because you pretend to be part of the nobility or of a class of society that you are in fact not.</p>

<p>While certain families have had coat of arms and family crests for generations, they all started at one point in time and just because your family didn&rsquo;t have one, and you really want one for your family, we think it&rsquo;s legitimate to simply start a new tradition. Of course, the design is entirely up to you.</p>

<p>Personally, my family never had a crest and I never felt the need to create a signet ring with something that was so personalized and old-fashioned. I really like to wear rings and I even have a bunch of rings in my collection that are made to be Signet rings; I simply prefer them without an engraving.</p>

<h2>Should You Get A Signet Ring? It&rsquo;s Up To You!</h2>

<p>At the end of the day, it&rsquo;s entirely up to you. It&rsquo;s a unique piece of jewelry and as a man, besides your wedding band and maybe your collar pin or a tie pin or your cufflinks, there&rsquo;s not a whole lot of jewelry you can wear and still appear elegant.</p>

<h2>What Finger Should You Wear Your Signet Ring On?</h2>

<p>There are no hard and fast rules, so you can wear a ring on any finger you choose! That being said, there are many traditions about<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/what-rings-mean-on-each-finger/">&nbsp;which fingers rings should go on</a>. In Britain, traditionally, the signet ring is worn on the pinky finger of the left hand. During Victorian times, men would wear their pinky ring and their wedding band stacked together on the left pinky finger. Winston Churchill wore his signet on his right ring finger.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Churchill-with-signet-ring-on-the-right-hand-ring-finger.jpeg"><img alt="Britain Churchill Soviets" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Churchill-with-signet-ring-on-the-right-hand-ring-finger-1030x639.jpeg" /></a></p>

<p>In Britain, there&rsquo;s a clear preference for the pinky finger of the left hand but ultimately,&nbsp;it&rsquo;s entirely up to you. For example, I wear my wedding band on the left ring finger which is right next to a pinky finger, so I don&rsquo;t wear a ring immediately next to it. I wear my rings (aside from my wedding band) on my right ring or pinky fingers.</p>

<h2>Signet Ring Metal &amp; Style Options</h2>

<p>Most rings come in 10, 14, or 18 karat gold. Either a white gold or rose gold or yellow gold. You can also go with sterling silver which is a lot less&nbsp;expensive but also with things like palladium which are more expensive.</p>

<p>Most rings come with a flat stone on top that can be engraved. If you don&rsquo;t like a center stone, you can also go with simple metal. Traditional shapes include round, oval, or long oval, or rectangular, squares with rounded edges, or even like cut edges that gives you an octagonal look, there really is no limit under the sun as long as the stone is flat and not domed.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Unengraved-signet-rings-in-rose-gold-with-oval-bloodstone-on-the-left-and-yellow-gold-cut-bloodstone-on-the-right.jpg"><img alt="Unengraved signet rings in rose gold with oval bloodstone on the left and yellow gold cut bloodstone on the right" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Unengraved-signet-rings-in-rose-gold-with-oval-bloodstone-on-the-left-and-yellow-gold-cut-bloodstone-on-the-right-1030x525.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>Unengraved signet rings in rose gold with oval bloodstone on the left and yellow gold cut bloodstone on the right</p>

<p>In terms of color and stones, the most popular are black onyx, blue lapis lazuli, a bloodstone, which is a dark green with red inclusions, you can also find a carnelian which is dark red, and we use those stones also for our cufflinks which you can find in our shop here which go quite well if you want to coordinate.</p>

<p>Signet Ring Styles and Shapes</p>

<h2>Signet Ring Shapes</h2>

<p>There are six shapes most commonly available in signet rings, with of course others that have been introduced over the years. Here are the popular six which have lasted through time:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Round</strong>: an elegant, traditional shape</li>
<li><strong>Straight Oval</strong>: by and large the most popular signet ring shape, it&rsquo;s very easy for the engraver to work with</li>
<li><strong>Oxford</strong>: a heavy, square-ish ring that takes the shape of a solid square or rectangle with rounded corners</li>
<li><strong>Bulbous Oval</strong>: a heavier, more distinctive looking ring that is nearly round</li>
<li><strong>Octagon</strong>: a very modern, far less traditional ring style</li>
<li><strong>Cushion</strong>: a favorite shape during the Victorian era, this is the next most popular style second to the straight oval</li>
</ul>

<h2>Engraving &amp; Ring Details</h2>

<p>For a crest, you should decide if you want it raised or engraved. When it comes to engraving, there are different options. You can either have it engraved at all the same<br />
depth or the more three-dimensional engraving which takes more time it looks much nicer but it&rsquo;s also more expensive.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Open-stone-setting-standard-on-most-rings.jpg"><img alt="" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Open-stone-setting-standard-on-most-rings-1030x580.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>Open signet ring setting</p>

<p>Another great detail in rings is where the bottom part of the stone is open or closed.&nbsp;By default, most rings are open so you can see the stones from the bottom. The problem with that is that it just collects dirt over time and it&rsquo;s very difficult to clean so you have the option to close that off with metal but since it uses more material, it&rsquo;s also more expensive.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Closed-setting-more-expensive-and-harder-to-find.jpg"><img alt="Closed setting - more expensive and harder to find" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Closed-setting-more-expensive-and-harder-to-find-1030x521.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>Closed setting &ndash; more expensive and harder to find</p>

<h2>Modern Signet Ring Options</h2>

<p>In recent years, technological advancements have allowed for laser-engraved signet rings. Personally, I think it looks cheaper, it&rsquo;s less traditional, and if you opt for a signet ring, you obviously like the tradition and the historic look. For the same reason, I&rsquo;d stay clear of showy diamonds because it&rsquo;s just too loud and it&rsquo;s not really part of the traditional signet ring.</p>

<h2>Where to Buy A Signet Ring</h2>

<p>There are a few options: custom made, vintage, or new. Custom made rings tend to run $2000 &ndash; $5000, while vintage rings can be much less expensive but also much less predictable in terms of price. For new pieces, consider checking out your local jeweler that caters to men.</p>

<h2>History of the Shoelace</h2>

<p>While historians haven&rsquo;t completely narrowed down the history of shoelaces, many believe in accordance with ancient recordings that shoelaces were probably rudimentarily invented sometime in early 3000 BC. The problem with dating it is that for the most part, shoes (as we call them today) that were worn in ancient times were actually just natural materials that were wrapped around the feet of the wearer as without protection and cushioning from the elements, the feet were even more prone to injury, infection and discomfort. One could assume that shoelaces have been around since the dawn of man, as it would seem almost obvious to anyone walking on unpaved natural ground that by covering up the feet, you might be able to survive walking for longer periods of time. Whether shoes were developed for treating injury or in prevention of it, one could presume that they would require some form of fastener in order to secure the material to your feet. If large leaves were used, they probably wouldn&rsquo;t stay on the bottom of your feet without tying them on, and whether it was strands of grass or another natural string, one could easily call this the invention of laces.</p>

<p>The Areni-1 shoe which was found and has been dated to 3500 BC was actually far more advanced than that, using leather shoelaces passed through slotted eyelets that were cut into animal hide used as shoes. In fact, in 3300 BC, there were even more complex shoes worn by &Ouml;tzi the Iceman, that he had tied on using lime bark cut into strings. While these are obviously barbaric versions of the shoelaces we have today, even footwear as far back as the 12th century had surpassed previous developments and were already quite similar to the laces we use today. The Museum of London has a variety of documented samples of medieval footwear that shows the wearer used laces that were passed through a series of hooks down the front or sides of the shoe. One very well known historical myth as it relates to shoelaces is a fairly common rumor that Gurkha soldiers, when fighting on behalf of Britain would quietly crawl the grounds, feeling the laces of other combatants since it was believed that British soldiers used straight lacing whereas the fighters for Japan criss-crossed their laces. In the dark of the night, the Gurkhas would crawl the battlefield feeling the laces discern friend from foe.</p>

<p>If we look into the past few centuries, traditional laces were made from a variety of natural materials including hemp, cotton, and various leathers. Virtually any materials used to manufacture ropes were adopted for use in shoelaces. Today, however, most shoelaces are made of synthetic materials rather than traditionally natural fibers. While the synthetic laces are far more durable and less prone to friction and rot, they are also very slippery and tend to come undone easier than the natural laces.</p>

<h2>Dress Shoelaces Should be Made of Waxed Cotton</h2>

<p>For dress shoes, it is essential&nbsp;to have quality shoelaces made of waxed cotton because cheap, thick and coarse shoelaces will ruin the look of your shoe laces. 80cm &ndash; 31.5&Prime; is the perfect length because it works for 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 rows of eyelets basically covering the entire spectrum of lace-up men&rsquo;s&nbsp;dress shoes.</p>

<h3>Round&nbsp;Shoelaces</h3>

<p>The most formal shoelaces&nbsp;for Oxford shoes are round, thin and made of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/accessories/shoelaces">waxed cotton</a>.&nbsp;The thinner your laces&nbsp;are the better the quality. Of course, that&rsquo;s only true if the laces don&rsquo;t rip but usually poor quality laces are not made to be very thin because they would break right away.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t want the shoelaces to snap&nbsp;when you pull on them. Even quality shoes like the ones from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/j-fitzpatrick-shoe-review/">J.Fitzpatrick</a>&nbsp;sometimes come with laces that are weak and rip the first time you lace them. If came that far and invested in quality goodyear-welted shoes, you should also get good pair of shoelaces or two.</p>

<h2>Flat Shoelaces</h2>

<p>An alternative for dress shoes is to go with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/accessories/shoelaces/flat-cotton-shoelaces">flat thin dress shoe laces</a>. They are a bit wider than round ones and create a different look that is a bit bolder than if you go with round shoelaces.</p>

<h2>Dress Boot Laces</h2>

<p>Generally,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/shop/accessories/shoelaces/boot-laces-round">boot laces</a>&nbsp;are thick, robust and made for work boots and the selection of shoelaces for dress boots such as the Balmoral boot is very limited.</p>

<p>For that reason, I created dress boot laces that are perfect for high-quality men&rsquo;s boots in the sense that they are not only durable but also stylish and elegant. For 95% of men&rsquo;s boots 120cm &ndash; 47.25&Prime;long laces are perfect, and hence I opted for that length. If you have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/the-chukka-boots-guide/" title="The Chukka Boots Guide">chukka boots</a>, or other boots with just 2,3,4 or 5 rows of eyelets, you should go with regular dress shoe laces. For all other boots, 120cm &ndash;&nbsp;47.25&Prime; is the ideal length.</p>

During my last trip to Europe, I was able to acquire a lot of Original 1930&rsquo;s silk shoe laces from France but unfortunately they were way too big for the eyelets on my shoes and so I replicated these in different materials so you can match them to your bow tie. We have Satin in 1cm and 1.5cm width, Grosgrain / Faille , Barathea and Velvet.</p>

<h2><strong>How to Mix Your Shoelace Color with Shoe Colors?</strong></h2>

<p>Today, you can basically mix and match your shoe colors in any way you want. If you want to be strictly classic, you stay with brown and black shoelaces or generally darker laces that match the shoes. For example black goes well with purple shoelaces, grey or blue. Brown is very versatile and works with almost anything green or brown. However, because there are so many shades of browns, you should play around a little bit to see what really works!</p>

<p>At the end of the day, it&rsquo;s all up to your creativity. Do you have a pair of black oxford&nbsp;shoes that are a bit too formal for a desired outfit? Try some yellow laces and they will look much more relaxed. Especially during&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-match-colors-patterns/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="How to Match Colors and Patterns For Classic Spring Summer Outfits">spring summer</a>&nbsp;season it is great these laces will make it look more casual, an</p>

Mathematically, there are a number of ways of how to tie your shoes but when it comes to classic men&rsquo;s clothing, things are much simpler, yet it seems like many men don&rsquo;t know how to tie shoelaces and places like GQ even teach it wrong.</p>

<p>As such it was time for us to create a hands-on video tutorial on how to lace Oxfords, Derbys and Co.</p>

<h3>How To Lace Oxford Shoes &ndash; Straight Lacing</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/oxford-shoes-guide/" title="The Oxford Shoes Guide">Oxford shoes</a>&nbsp;traditionally have a different lacing than derby shoes, and the gentlemanly way to lace oxfords is horizontally and parallel. Now, you can achieve the final look in various ways, however some are more difficult to tighten than others.</p>

<p>The Best Way to Lace Oxfords: This works for all kinds of oxfords, not matter how many eyelets they have. Most oxfords have 5 rows of eyelets, and that&rsquo;s what we use here.</p>

<ol>
<li>Insert both ends of the lace in the bottom holes /eyelets of the shoe, so you have a line that is horizontal and on top of the leather.</li>
<li>Pull both ends&nbsp;so they are even and have the same length if you have an even number of eyelets such as 4,6&hellip; For uneven eyelets, 5, 7 etc. the lace on the outside of the shoe should be about 2&Prime; &ndash; 5 cm longer.</li>
<li>Take the lace on the outside of the shoe, and insert it from the bottom in the second hole on the same side, and back into the second hole on the opposite side from the top.</li>
<li>Now, take the lace on the inside of the shoe&nbsp;and insert it from the bottom in the third&nbsp;hole on the same side, and back into the third hole on the opposite side from the top.</li>
<li>Continue in the same fashion. With an even number of eyelets, you will reach the top eyelets from the bottom on each side and it tools great. With uneven holes, you have to make a cross underneath with one end from the bottom. For that reason, one shoelace has to be longer than the other one.</li>
<li>Pull on both ends to tighten the lacing and tie your shoelace. Traditionally</li>

<p><img alt="" src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Catoir-Grosgrain-ad-from-1933-Illustration-by-Robert-Goodman-777x1030.jpg" /></p>

<h2>Silk Satin</h2>

<p>Firstly, it explained the dichotomy of&nbsp;Victorian and Edwardian&nbsp;sources referring&nbsp;to facings as being &ldquo;silk or satin&rdquo; as if the two were somehow mutually exclusive. &nbsp;In actual fact,&nbsp;satin is a finish that can be produced by&nbsp;numerous&nbsp;materials, including silk. &nbsp;Although some modern sources define satin solely as a synthetic version of silk, that is not only incorrect (likely stemming from the fact that most satin textiles these days are indeed cheaper synthetics, ) but it obviously couldn&rsquo;t apply to facings made prior&nbsp;to the 1940s as polyester had not yet been invented. &nbsp;This had me scratching my head for many years until I came across the aforesaid&nbsp;reference&nbsp;in&nbsp;a 1936 fashion magazine:</p>

<p>Lapels of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/tuxedo-black-tie-guide/classic/tuxedo-dinner-suit/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Classic Tuxedo">single-breasted dinner jackets</a>&nbsp;are usually faced with dull silk, grosgrain or barathea. &nbsp;With the more informal double-breasted&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/dinner-jacket-black-tie-guide/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Dinner Jacket Black Tie Guide">dinner jacket,</a>&nbsp;many men have the shawl collar faced with satin.</p>

<p><img alt="This midnight blue jacket features lapels faced in black grosgrain silk." src="https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Midnight-Blue-Tuxedo-Jacket-Black-Lapels-1030x687.jpg" /></p>

<p>This midnight blue jacket features lapels faced in black grosgrain silk.</p>

<h2>Dull Silk &ndash; A Forgotten Tuxedo Lapel Material</h2>

<p>The passage suggested to me that early authorities used&nbsp;the term &lsquo;silk&rsquo; as shorthand for &lsquo;dull silk&rsquo;. &nbsp;I searched&nbsp;my archives for similar references&nbsp;and found this&nbsp;caption&nbsp;in a 1940 issue of&nbsp;<em>Esquire</em>: &ldquo;the new satin shawl collar and more conventional dull silk peak lapel&rdquo;. The classification&nbsp;of dull silk as&nbsp;&ldquo;conventional&rdquo;&nbsp;certainly re-enforces my theory&nbsp;that &lsquo;dull&rsquo;&nbsp;was implied&nbsp;in early references to &lsquo;silk&rsquo; facings. The second revelation was that&nbsp;&lsquo;satin&rsquo; is a fairly fluid term today, kind of like &ldquo;midnight blue&rdquo;. &nbsp;The facings on my various tuxedos might or might not qualify&nbsp;as satin (see the very technical description&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satin" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>) but they are a far cry from the high-gloss appearance I associate with that term. &nbsp;I would more accurately describe them as being dull silk because even though it has no fixed definition the term much more accurately captures&nbsp;their low-lustre finish.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s good to know that grosgrain isn&rsquo;t the only option for understated trim considering how rare it is. &nbsp;Certainly, if I were to find myself in the market for another tuxedo, I would pay much more attention to the sheen quotient of the facings to make sure I stay far away from the glossy look of rental wear.</p>
